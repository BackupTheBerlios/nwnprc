<br><br>At this point, you should have the basic PRC installed into
the original campaigns.

<br><br>This means:

<br><br>75+ new prestige classes

<br><br>New feats and spells

<br><br>Epic Spell System, with lots of new epic spells

<br><br>Access to dozens of Persistent Worlds that are using the PRC

<br><br>&nbsp;

<br><br>However, there are some additional features which need extra
installation:

<br><br>New races

<br><br>New base classes at level 1

<br><br>&nbsp;

<br><br>These are enabled using the java Character Creator, and that
is covered over the next few pages.

<br><br>
<br><br>Since the java Character Creator is powered by java, the first
step is to ensure that java is setup and installed on your PC.

<br><br>The first step is to go to <a href="http://www.java.com">
http://www.java.com</a> It should look something like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/22%20java%20web%202.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>From there , you need to click on the yellow button in the top
right, here shown as &quot;Looking for the Java Virtual Machine?&quot; but
the exact details of that page change.

<br><br>That will then start a process to detect and download java to
your PC. It may look like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/23%20java%20web%203.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Note the blue shield just below the address bar at the top of
the screen. This is windows XP SP2 trying to protect you, simply click on the
yellow bar and allow the control to proceed by selecting &quot;Install&quot; from the box
that appears.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/24%20java%20web%204.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Once you have started installing java, it should look like
this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/25%20java%20install%201.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Make sure that you read the license agreement and accept it
before clicking &quot;Next &gt;&quot;

<br><br>The next screen looks like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/26%20java%20install%202.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>A typical installation is fine for most PCs, so simply click
&quot;Next &gt;&quot; to continue.

<br><br>One the process has finished, it will look like this.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/27%20java%20install%203.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Press the &quot;Finish&quot; button to end the installation and then you
can move on to the next step.

<br><br>Now you can go and get the Character Creator itself.

<br><br>As with the PRC, the place to start is NWVault, but this time
enter Character Creator into the search box.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/28%20nwvault%20again.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>This will get a result set like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/29%20nwvault%20search.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Though the PRC Character Creator appears several times, they
all point to the same entry. Pick one and click on it.

<br><br>Then you will have a window like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/30%20nwvault%20javacc.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>As with the main PRC download, select Download File and save
it to your desktop.

<br><br>The java CC is distributed using a compression system called
RAR. Usually the program to open it is WinRar, which is covered in the next
step.

<br><br>Now you have the java CC downloaded to your computer but in a
compressed format.

<br><br>If you don't have it already, I suggest you get WinRAR.

<br><br>To start with go to <a href="http://www.rarlabs.com">
http://www.rarlabs.com</a>

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/32%20winrar.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Then go to the downloads page via the link on the left of the
screen.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/33%20winrar%20download.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The normal version you need is the top one on the list, WinRAR
3.42

<br><br>Again, you will get a warning message from windows.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/34%20winrar%20download%202.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Select &quot;Save&quot; and then place it on your desktop.

<br><br>After it has finished downloading, you will end up with your
desktop looking something like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/35%20winrar%20desktop.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The next step is to start the installation of WinRAR by
double-clicking on the wrar342.exe program.

<br><br>Windows may warn you again about the program with a message
like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/36%20winrar%20warning.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>As with the main PRC package, select &quot;Run&quot; if you are
confident that the file contains no viruses.

<br><br>The first install screen looks like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/37%20winrar%20install%201.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Make sure that the destination folder is correct and that you
agree to the agreement.

<br><br>WinRAR is shareware, if you continue to use it after 40 days,
you must register it for a small fee.

<br><br>After the &quot;Install&quot; button is clicked, it will install WinRAR
onto your PC.

<br><br>Then it will prompt you as to which options you wish to use:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/38%20winrar%20install%202.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Once the settings are tailored to your satisfaction, press the
&quot;OK&quot; button to complete the installation.

<br><br>Now that you have WinRAR installed, you can extract the java
CC from its distribution package.

<br><br>To do so, simply right click on the file on your desktop and
select &quot;WinRAR&quot; then &quot;Extract Here&quot;.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/39%20javacc%20extract.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>This will extract a pair of files, cc.jar and RUN_CC.bat.
<br><br>The &quot;cc.jar&quot; file is the java Character Creator program
itself.
<br><br>The &quot;RUN_CC.bat&quot; is a batch file you should
use to run the Character Creator.

<br><br>By now you should have the java CC file &quot;cc.jar&quot; and the batch file &quot;RUN_CC.bat&quot; extracted
from the rar and sitting on your desktop.

<br><br>To start the java CC, simply doubleclick on the &quot;RUN_CC.bat&quot; file.

<br><br>Congratulations! At this stage you should have the java CC
running correctly.

<br><br>Now that the java Character Creator is installed and working
correctly, you should have a screen like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/45%20javacc%20start.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to tell it to use the PRC
files.

<br><br>&nbsp;To do so, press the &quot;Settings&quot; button and setup the next
screen so that it looks like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/46%20javacc%20settings.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The directories will vary depending where you installed NWN.

<br><br>Once the settings are correct, press the &quot;OK&quot; button to return
to the main screen.

<br><br>Back at the main screen, press the &quot;Create Character&quot; button
to start to make a character.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/47%20javacc%20main.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The java Character Creator is designed to replicate biowares
in-game character creator.

<br><br>As such, you go through the same stages as normal in creating
your character.

<br><br>One change is at the potraits stage.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/48%20javacc%20portrait.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Here there are two checkboxes on the left of the screen.

<br><br>These restrict which portraits are displayed, based on gender
or race.

<br><br>If you are using a new PRC race, you will have to deselect
&quot;Lock to Race&quot; in order to see any portraits.

<br><br>Once you have reached the end of the process, press &quot;Finalize&quot;
to create the character.

<br><br>And once you have made your character, you can select it
in-game by pressing &quot;Use a pre-made character&quot; and selecting it from the list
that appears.
