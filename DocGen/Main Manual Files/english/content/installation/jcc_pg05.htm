<br><br>By now you should have the java CC file &quot;cc.jar&quot; and the batch file &quot;RUN_CC.bat&quot; extracted
from the rar and sitting on your desktop.

<br><br>To start the java CC, simply doubleclick on the &quot;RUN_CC.bat&quot; file.

<br><br>Congratulations! At this stage you should have the java CC
running correctly.

<br><br>Now that the java Character Creator is installed and working
correctly, you should have a screen like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/45%20javacc%20start.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The first thing you need to do is to tell it to use the PRC
files.

<br><br>&nbsp;To do so, press the &quot;Settings&quot; button and setup the next
screen so that it looks like this:

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/46%20javacc%20settings.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The directories will vary depending where you installed NWN.

<br><br>Once the settings are correct, press the &quot;OK&quot; button to return
to the main screen.

<br><br>Back at the main screen, press the &quot;Create Character&quot; button
to start to make a character.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/47%20javacc%20main.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>The java Character Creator is designed to replicate biowares
in-game character creator.

<br><br>As such, you go through the same stages as normal in creating
your character.

<br><br>One change is at the potraits stage.

<br><br>
<center> <img border="0" src="../../../images/48%20javacc%20portrait.jpg" /> </center>

<br><br>Here there are two checkboxes on the left of the screen.

<br><br>These restrict which portraits are displayed, based on gender
or race.

<br><br>If you are using a new PRC race, you will have to deselect
&quot;Lock to Race&quot; in order to see any portraits.

<br><br>Once you have reached the end of the process, press &quot;Finalize&quot;
to create the character.

<br><br>And once you have made your character, you can select it
in-game by pressing &quot;Use a pre-made character&quot; and selecting it from the list
that appears.
