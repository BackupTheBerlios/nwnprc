<br><h4>NOTE: The ConvoCC is still a work-in-progress. Please report any bugs and issues you might have, after first checking that you have followed this guide, that the issues have not already been fixed, and that it is a reporoducable bug. Make sure you include as much information as possible in reports, including at least what OS and database you are running, where you got the ConvoCC from, what haks you are using, how you precached the 2das, what character you are building, and exactly what steps you take to expose the bug. A screenshot of the bug as well as both the serverlog and NWNX-ODBC log files is also very helpful. Without reliable feedback and reports, I cannot improve the ConvoCC. Thank you for your cooperation.</h4>
<br>
<br>This is a step-by-step guide on how to install the PRC Server Pack.
<br>The PRC Server Pack is needed if you want to do any of the following:
<ul><li>Use the Conversation Character Creator. This allows the creation of
characters with new races, new classes or other custom content at level 1.
<li>Use the Letoscript enhancements for things such as permanent stat adjustments, etc.
<li>Use a database other than biowares to cache 2da information in.</ul>

<br>The system is composed of several components. Firstly, there is <a href="www.nwnx.org">NWNX2</a>.
This is an application that hooks into memory locations of the NWServer in order to pass information
into and out of the game. It relies on plugins to provide functionallity.
<br>
<br>Two plugins are included in the PRC Server Pack:
<br>One is a database plugin, <a href="http://www.nwnx.org/index.php?id=doc_odbc2">NWNX-ODBC2</a>, which is used
to access a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite database</a>.
<br>The other is the <a href="http://weathersong.infopop.cc/groupee/forums/a/frm/f/9616039431">NWNX-Letoscript</a> plugin <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92983&package_id=111517">build 24</a>.
<br>
<br>There is also a prechacher tool build-into prc.jar and a stand-alone SQLite commandline tool.
These are used to insert the 2da files into the database where they can be accessed quicker.
<br>
<br>Many servers may already have NWNX setup, possibly already using NWNX-ODBC2 to provide database functionallity. Some servers use MySQL instead of SQLite as a database. In these cases, the precacher can be set to provide MySQL compatible syntax. (NOTE: I know little about non-SQLite databases, so I dont know how well this works or any details of it. If you have more information, please contact the PRC team so this manual can be updated)
