<br>
<br>This is a step-by-step guide on how to install the PRC Server Pack.
<br>The PRC Server Pack is needed if you want to do any of the following:
<ul><li>Use the Conversation Character Creator. This allows the creation of
characters with new races or other custom content at level 1.
<li>Use the Letoscript enhancements for things such as permanent stat adjustments, etc.</ul>
<br>
<br>The system is composed of several components. Firstly, there is <a href="www.nwnx.org">NWNX2</a>.
This is an application that hooks into memory locations of the NWServer in order to pass information
into and out of the game. It relies on plugins to provide functionallity.
<br>Two plugs are provided in the PRC Server Pack. One is a database plugin, ODBC2, which is used
to access a SQLite database. The other is the Letoscript plugin.
<br>There is also a prechacher tool build-into prc.jar and a stand-alone SQLite commandline tool.
These are used to insert the 2da files into the database where they can be accessed quicker.
