<br>Psionics is a similar system to conventional spellcasting, however there are a number of important points that separate them.

<br>Most of the terms that refer to spells have direct equivalents in psionics.<ul>
	<li>Psionic spells are called <i><b>powers</b></i>.</li>
	<li>Metamagic-type abilities are called <i><b>metapsionics</b></i>.</li>
	<li>A character than can use psionic powers is a <i><b>manifester</b></i> and powers are used at a certain <i><b>manifester level</b></i> instead of caster level.</li>
	<li>Powers are divided into 9 <i><b>power levels</b></i> (I to IX) in the same way spells are divided into spell levels. However, there are no psionic cantrips.</li>
	<li>Like spells, powers are separated into groups, however, instead of schools they are referred to as <i><b>disciplines</b></i> and are:<ul>
		<li>Psychometabolism. A user is are known as a Egoist.</li>
		<li>Psychokinesis. A user is are known as a Kineticist.</li>
		<li>Psychoportation. A user is are known as a Nomad.</li>
		<li>Clairsentience. A user is are known as a Seer.</li>
		<li>Metacreativity. A user is are known as a Shaper.</li>
		<li>Telepathy. A user is are known as a Telepath.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Resistance to powers is called <i><b>power resistance</b></i> and is interchangeable with spell resistance. Power resistance also resists spells and spell resistance also resists powers.</li>
	<li>As with spells, most offensive powers have a saving throw to avoid or reduce their effects. The DC on the power is normally 10 + relevant ability modifier + power level. Certain other abilities such as feats can alter the DC as well.</li>
	<li>The 3 main psionic base classes have approximate equivalent spellcasting classes. <i><b>psions</b></i> are similar to wizards, <i><b>wilders</b></i> are similar to sorcerers, and <i><b>psy warriors</b></i> are similar to a combination of bards and paladin/rangers.</li>
	<li>As with divine casters, manifesters are not affected by wearing armor or using a shield. However, psions are not proficient with them, and wilders are only proficient with light armor and shields. They can spend feats to become proficient however.</li>
</ul>
