Manual generator:

To use the Autodoc, create directories 2da/ and tlk/ in the location you will
be running it from. This location should also contain the directory
templates/ and the file settings from the CVS. Make a copy of
Main Manual Files/ called manual/

Place dialog.tlk and prc_consortium.tlk equivalents for each language
specified in settings in tlk/. Place the following 2das in 2da/

classes.2da
domains.2da
feat.2da
masterfeats.2da
racialtypes.2da
skills.2da
spells.2da

all cls_atk*.2da
all cls_savthr*.2da
all cls_skill*.2da
all cls_feat*.2da
all race_feat_*.2da



If you have make installed, run "make" and "make run" to generate the manual.
There are other run options present in the makefile for those interested.
If you do not have make, run
	javac -source 1.5 -target 1.5 prc/autodoc/*.java
and
	java -Xmx300m -Xms300m prc/autodoc/Main

use parameters --help or -? to get info about other possible parameters.

Script generator:

Use:
Compile the CodeGen class.
Run it:
	java CodeGen namePrefix templatePath 2daPaths...

where namePrefix   = the base name that all the resulting scripts will share
      templatePath = the filename of the template used to generate the scripts
      2daPaths...  = any number of filenames of 2das used to fill in the
                     blanks in the template

The 2das are applied in the order given. This only has effect on the filename,
which is built up from the namePrefix + Suffix column of each of the 2das + .nss

The 2das must contain two columns, Suffix and Value. Suffix is added to the
filename as described above, and Value is used to replace all instances of
the 2da's name in the template.

Example template and 2das:

**********template.txt*********
void main(){
	int ~~~Foo~~~ = ~~~Bar~~~;
}
*******************************
************Foo.2da************
2DA V2.0

    Suffix    Value
0   a         alpha
1   b         beta
2   c         gamma
*******************************
************Bar.2da************
2DA V2.0

    Suffix    Value
0   1         delta
1   2         epsilon
2   32        phi
