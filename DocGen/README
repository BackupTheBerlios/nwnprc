To use the Autodoc, create directories 2da/ and tlk/ in the location you will be
running it from. This location should also contain the directory templates/ and
the file settings from the CVS. Make a copy of Main Manual Files/ called
manual/

Place dialog.tlk and prc_consortium.tlk equivalents for each language specified in
settings in tlk/. Place the following 2das in 2da/

classes.2da
domains.2da
feat.2da
masterfeats.2da
racialtypes.2da
skills.2da
spells.2da

all cls_atk*.2da
all cls_savthr*.2da
all cls_skill*.2da
all cls_feat*.2da
all race_feat_*.2da



If you have make installed, run "make" and "make run" to generate the manual. There are
other run options present in the makefile for those interested.
If you do not have make, run
	javac -source 1.5 -target 1.5 prc/autodoc/*.java
and
	java -Xmx300m -Xms300m prc/autodoc/Main

use parameters --help or -? to get info about other possible parameters.
