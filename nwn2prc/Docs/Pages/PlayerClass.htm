<p align="left">The PRC pack adds over 40 new classes. Due to Bioware  limitations, 
  these are all implemented as Prestige Classes, though some are  designed 
 as core classes (i.e. can be taken at level 1) and thus have very  relaxed 
 prerequisites (e.g. Archer, Samurai). Some classes are different  flavours 
 of the same base (e.g. the elemental savants; 8 flavours for 4 elements 
in both divine and arcane spellcasting). Other classes are re-designs of existing
Bioware  classes (e.g. Pen 'n' Paper (PnP) Shifter). A few classes are classes
based upon templates  (e.g. Lich) and as such they do not gain any saves
or base attack bonus.</p>

 them that if they die in battle, they will return stronger than before as 
 a just reward. Therefore, they have no fear of death. Battleragers command 
 a grudging, if fearful, respect within dwarven society, where they are known

<p align="left"> <a name="Drunken_Master"></a><u><b> Drunken Master<br>
</b></u>Martial arts students face a bewildering array of martial arts schools,
each with its own adherents and detractors. But few schools are as unusual
-- or as controversial -- as Drunken Boxing. By weaving and staggering about
as if inebriated, drunken boxers avoid many blows. Likewise, their stumbling,
lurching attacks catch their opponents off guard. Moreover, when they actually
imbibe alcohol, Drunken Masters can perform truly prodigious feats of strength
and bravery. <br>
<br>
- Hit Die: d8 <br>
- Proficiencies: The Drunken Master gains no proficiencies in weapons or
armor. <br>
- Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier. <br>
<br>
REQUIREMENTS: <br>
<br>
Base Attack Bonus: +4. <br>
Class: Monk level 1, Rogue level 2 or Shadowdancer level 2. (Needed for Evasion
ability) <br>
Feats: Great Fortitude, Dodge. <br>
Tumble: 6 ranks. <br>
<br>
1: Drink Like a Demon - Your body handles alcohol differently from other
people. Every bottle or tankard of alcohol you consume reduces your Dexterity,
Wisdom, and Intelligence by 1 point each, but increases your Strength and
Constitution by 1 point. However, your Reflex save bonus, Dexterity bonus
to Tumble, and AC bonus remain at their original levels regardless of your
new Dexterity modifier. <br>
    Bottle Proficiency - You can use bottles as weapons using your unarmed
base attack bonus. <br>
2: Stagger - By tripping, stumbling, and staggering, you can make a charge
attack that surprises your opponents. <br>
3: Swaying Waist - You weave and bob about as you attack. You gain a +2 dodge
bonus to AC against any one opponent during your turn. <br>
4: Disarm - Character can attempt to disarm an opponent at a -6 penalty to
their attack. <br>
5: Drunken Rage - Drunken Master can rage just as a barbarian does, with
duration of 1 hour. You gain +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 morale
bonus on Will saves, and a 2 penalty to AC. This ability works when you drink
an alcoholic beverage. <br>
6: Lurch - Your lurching movements let you make one feinting-in-combat Bluff
check (opposed by opponents Intelligence modifier + Charisma modifier) per
round. On a successful feint, the opponents Dexterity modifier is not added
to his AC on the Drunken Masters next attack. You can only lurch other humanoids.
<br>
7: Drunken Embrace - The Drunken Master can grapple an opponent without provoking
an attack of opportunity, and you gain a +4 competence bonus on all opposed
grapple checks. <br>
8: For Medicinal Purposes - By combining your ki power with alcohol, you
can convert an alcoholic drink to a potion of heal up to three times per
day. Potion only works on character creating it. <br>
9: Improved Disarm - Character no longer incurs an attack of opportunity
while attempting to disarm and the penalty drops to -4. <br>
10: Breath of Flame - You can use your ki to ignite the alcohol within you
and spew it forth from your mouth in a breath of flame. <br>

    Known Issues: <br>
    <br>
    -Precise Strike could not be implemented past 2d6, since there are no 
damage  constants for 3 or more d6 <br>
    -Enhanced Mobility could not be implemented <br>
    -Deflect Arrows wasn't working correctly, so it was replaced with a free
  Spring Attack feat <br>
    -Elaborate Parry would have required a heartbeat script to work like
the   PnP version. So, instead of giving an AC bonus when parrying, it simply
gives  a bonus to parry skill. <br>

<p align="left">The master of shrouds is an evil spellcaster who magically
  seizes incorporeal undead and sets them to do her bidding. The wrathful
undead  spread fear and death as they vent their anger at being disturbed.
<br>
    While a master of shrouds has some divine spells, her primary tool is 
the  ability to summon incorporeal undead creatures to serve her. Evil clerics
  most often become masters of shrouds, though ex-paladins may do so if they
  turn far enough from their lawful good roots and gain access to one of
the   required domains. <br>

</b></u>Samurai are professional warriors, members of the noble class who

in society, they are born for it, born into a system of allegiance, loyality,
and honor that influences every stage of their lives. A samurai cut loose

with no honor and no standing in society. <br>

samurai have two masterwork weapons - a katana and a wakizashi.  These are
weapons that belonged to the samurais' ancestors, and protecting the weapons
is an important point of honor for the samurai.  As a samurai acquires treasure
through adventuring, he has the option of awakening the supernatural abilities
latent in the weapons.  He may spend gold or sacrifice items to further enchant
his weapon.<br>

<p align="left">The tempest is the point of calm within a whirling barrier
  of deadly blades. Poets use colorful terms such as dancer to describe the
  movement of a tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this fighting
style   is not about dancing . Nor is it about impressing anyone - least
of all poets.  The tempest focuses on learning the ultimate secrets of two-weapon
fighting  for a single purpose - the destruction of her enemies. <br>
