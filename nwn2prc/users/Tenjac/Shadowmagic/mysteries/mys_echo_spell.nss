/**@file Echo Spell
Initiate, Black Magic
Level/School: 5th/Universal
Range: Close
Effect: Repeat a previously cast spell or mystery
Duration:  See text
Saving Throw: See text 
Spell Resistance: See text

You can "echo" a mystery or spell cast by anyone 
other than yourself, casing it to remanifest under 
your control. Both the caster and the effect must
have been within echo spell's range, and the entire
casting must have occurred in the previous round.
You choose the mystery or spell's target, and make
any other choices involved in casting it. You cast
the mystery or spell using your mystery user level
(use your Cha modifier to determine the mystery or
spell's DC; its duration, saves, and the like are
as normal for that spell). You cannot echo a mystery 
or spell of a higher level than the highest-level
mystery you can cast, and you can never echo a 
mystery or a spell of higher than 4th level.
