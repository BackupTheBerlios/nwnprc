Master, Eyes of the Night Sky
Level/School: 9th/Divination
Range: Personal
Duration:  10 minutes/level

This mystery grants you knowledge of what will occur
(or at least what is likely to occur), granting you
several benefits. You gain the uncanny dodge ability,
a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks (you always
get to act in a surprise round), and a +4 insight
bonus of Armor Class.

In addition, you can discharge the energy of this 
mystery as an immediate action to cause an attack
to miss you that would otherwise have been successful.
You can declare that you are using this ability after
the result of the attack roll is known, but you must 
do so before damage is determined. Using this ability
discharges and ends the mystery

You can also discharge the energy of this mystery as
an immediate action to immediately reroll one failed 
saving throw.  Using this ability discharges and ends
the mystery.
