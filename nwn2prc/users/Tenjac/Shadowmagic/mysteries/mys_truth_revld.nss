Master, Eyes of the Night Sky
Level/School: 7th/Divination
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 minute/level

At its most basic, this mystery functions like the
spell true seeing. You can also, by concentrating 
on a particular creature or object for 1 minute or
more, gain additional on that subject. However, 
because the distortion between worlds and the 
twisting effect of shadows, any additional 
inormation gained in this manner might be false or
misleading.

The table above indicates what other mystical effects
can be duplicated with truth revealed. Concentrating
on a specific target requires a substantial amount of
time, during which you can only take move actions, 
and cannot focus on any other target. At the end of 
this period, the target makes a saving throw against
the DC of truth revealed to resist the detection
effect.  Spell resistance applied to this further 
detection effort as well. You may not attempt any one
effect on the same target more than once per use of
truth revealed. Remember that these effects are in
addition to the basic knowledge granted by true 
seeing, which occurs instantly and reliably.
