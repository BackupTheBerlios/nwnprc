/**@file Umbral Touch
Apprentice, Touch of Twilight
Level/School: 3rd/Conjuration
Range: Touch
Target: Creature or creatures touched
Duration:  1 minute/level; see text
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial; see text 
Spell Resistance: Yes

Umbral Touch infuses one of your hands with dark, 
shadowy eneryg, allowing you to make debilitating
melee touch attacks. A successful strike deals 5d6
points of damage to a target, which must succeed on
a Fortitude saving throw or also be slowed. While 
this mystery is active, you threaten an area as if
you were armed and can make attacks of opportunity
with your umbral touch.

This mystery completely occupies one of your hands, 
as if you were holding an object in that hand. If
you have another open hand, you can cast other 
mysteries or spells normally, even those with a
range of touch, but you cannot deliver another touch
mystery or touch spell and make an attack with umbral
touch in the same round.

This effect normally lasts for 1 minute per level, but
each successful touch attack shortens the duration by
1 minute (allowing you to make one successful attack
per level before the effect is discharged).
