/**@file Warp Spell
Initiate, Black Magic
Level/School: 4th/Abjuration
Range: Close
Target: A spell or mystery cast by someone else
Duration:  Instantaneous
Saving Throw:  Will negates; see text
Spell Resistance: No

You can cast this mystery as an immediate action to
warp another caster's spell or mystery. In this case,
warp spell must be used at the moment of the other
caster's casting. To be successful, you must beat the
other caster on an opposed caster level check (1d20 +
caster level). If you do not, you have failed to take
control of his spell or mystery, and it manifests
normally.

If you succeed on the opposed check, the other caster's 
mystery or spell is countered, as if you had used the
counter-spell action successfully, and you gain one
additional use of an apprentice path mystery that you 
know. You can keep this additional use until a later
turn (requiring a standard action to activate), but 
it must be used within 1 hour or it is lost. You can
also combine the activation of the additional spell
or mystery with the immediate action required for the
warp spell mystery itself, allowing you to cast the 
apprentice-path mystery out of turn.
