 Description		"The jann (singular janni are the weakiest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. They favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety.\nJann society is very open, treating males and females as equals. Each trive is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need they gather and comman large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans).\nMany jann bands are nomadic, traveling with herds of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann are often mistaken for humans -- until they are attacked. The territory of a jann tribe can extend for hundreds of miles."

 Special Abilities	Darkvision
 			Change size (Sp): Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
 			Elemental Endurance (Ex): Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

Stone giants can live to be 800 years old.\nStone giants may tend to be shy around strangers, but they are by no means timid. Many stone giants have an artistic streak. Some draw and paint scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some are fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces.\nMost stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond of rock-throwing contests and other games that test their might. Groups of giants often gather to toss rocks at each other, the losing side being those who are hit more often. Travelers' reports of such contests have given stone giants their reputation for wildness."

 Description		"Satyrs, also known as fauns, are hedonistic creatures that frolic in the wild places of the world. They love fine food, strong drink and passionate romance.\nA satyr's hair is red or chestnut brown, while its hooves and horns are jet black.\nA satyr is far more likely to be carrying musical instruments or bottles of wine than weapons. For the most part, satyrs leave travelers alone. They are, however, more than a little mischievous and often seek fun at the expense of those who wander too near their woodland homes. A satyr is about as tall and heavy as a half-elf."

When it plays, all creatures within a 60-foot spread (except satyrs) must succeed on a DC 13 Will save or be affected by charm person, sleep, or fear (caster level 10th; the satyr chooses the tune and its effect). In the hands of other beings, these pipes have no special powers. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipe's effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.\nA satyr often uses its pipes to charm and seduce especially comely women or to put a party of adventurers to sleep and then steal their valuables.

Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.

Their heads are a bit larger than a human’s, with a sloping brow and a prodigious jaw filled with large strong teeth capable of cracking bones.

Their toes are also long and thin, with long sharp toenails. Uldra skin is generally pale blue or even snow white.

  Description		"Frost folk are an isolated and xenophobic race descended from humans who struck a bargain with the gods of winter. In exchange for power over snow and ice, they sold their souls to a cruel deity—or, as some claim, an archdevil. Frost folk are almost always encountered alone, a single frost man sometimes accompanied by a hunting winter wolf. They are of the height and weight of a typical human male, with bright blue eyes, and pale snowy skin. They favour finely stitched furs, often artic fox, ermine, or bearskin. Some wear helmets made from bear, wolf, or wolverine skulls. A noticeable chill surrounds them. Frost folk villages are extremely remote, found only in very cold terrain. These villages are often cliff dwellings in mountains, deep glacial caverns, or underground caverns deep under everfrost or boreal forests. Frost folk are excellent hunters and herdsmen, keeping flocks of caribou, musk oxen, and mountain sheep. A few villages are able to grow crops around hot springs, in sheltered valleys, and in some warm forested valleys."

Khaastas have tough, small scales, and flaring crests that are colored in intricate, wild patterns unique to each individual. They have long, powerful tails that are used for balance rather than combat. / Most khaatas travel in nomadic bands in the Outer Planes, where they look for loot, slaves, and combat. They hire themselves out to anyone that seems powerful (and in their eyes, worthy) enough to command them, but they backstab their patron at the first sign of weakness."

  Description           "Asabis are desert-dwelling, reptilian humanoids. Native to the Isstosseffifil Empire, which stood Where the Anauroch desert is now, asabis are still primarily found within and beneath the Great Desert. The name asabi was giving to these creatures by the Bendine tribes. In earlier times, they were known as the laerti—a name given to them by the Netherese. / Asabi are warlike creatures with a love of battle unequalled by most other races. They often form mercenary bands or are enlisted into the service of more powerful evil creatures./ Standard asabis are primarly warriors. They enjoy fighting, and they are accustomed to organizing themselves in disciplined ranks. Asabis are habby to fight for their masters (if enslaved) or for whoever pays them the most gold.”
