 Description		"The jann (singular janni are the weakiest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. They favor forlorn deserts and hidden oases, where they have both privacy and safety.\nJann society is very open, treating males and females as equals. Each trive is ruled by a sheik and one or two viziers. Exceptionally powerful sheiks are given the title of amir, and in times of need they gather and comman large forces of jann (and sometimes allied humans).\nMany jann bands are nomadic, traveling with herds of camels, goats, or sheep from oasis to oasis. These itinerant jann are often mistaken for humans -- until they are attacked. The territory of a jann tribe can extend for hundreds of miles."

 Special Abilities	Darkvision
 			Change size (Sp): Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an enlarge person or reduce person spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.
 			Elemental Endurance (Ex): Jann can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air, Earth, Fire or Water for up to 48 hours. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

Stone giants can live to be 800 years old.\nStone giants may tend to be shy around strangers, but they are by no means timid. Many stone giants have an artistic streak. Some draw and paint scenes of their lives on the walls of their lairs and on tanned hide scrolls. Some are fond of music and play stone flutes and drums. Others make simple jewelry, fashioning painted stone beads into necklaces.\nMost stone giants are playful, especially at night. They are fond of rock-throwing contests and other games that test their might. Groups of giants often gather to toss rocks at each other, the losing side being those who are hit more often. Travelers' reports of such contests have given stone giants their reputation for wildness."

 Description		"Satyrs, also known as fauns, are hedonistic creatures that frolic in the wild places of the world. They love fine food, strong drink and passionate romance.\nA satyr's hair is red or chestnut brown, while its hooves and horns are jet black.\nA satyr is far more likely to be carrying musical instruments or bottles of wine than weapons. For the most part, satyrs leave travelers alone. They are, however, more than a little mischievous and often seek fun at the expense of those who wander too near their woodland homes. A satyr is about as tall and heavy as a half-elf."

The save DC is Charisma-based.\nA satyr often uses its pipes to charm and seduce especially comely women or to put a party of adventurers to sleep and then steal their valuables.

Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyte's stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.

Their toes are also long and thin, with long sharp toenails. Uldra skin is generally pale blue or even snow white.

Frost folk are almost always encountered alone, a single frost man sometimes accompanied by a hunting winter wolf. They are of the height and weight of a typical human male, with bright blue eyes, and pale snowy skin. They favour finely stitched furs, often artic fox, ermine, or bearskin. Some wear helmets made from bear, wolf, or wolverine skulls. A noticeable chill surrounds them. Frost folk villages are extremely remote, found only in very cold terrain. These villages are often cliff dwellings in mountains, deep glacial caverns, or underground caverns deep under everfrost or boreal forests. Frost folk are excellent hunters and herdsmen, keeping flocks of caribou, musk oxen, and mountain sheep. A few villages are able to grow crops around hot springs, in sheltered valleys, and in some warm forested valleys."

A snakelike sarrukh has a serpentine body and head, plus two powerful arms that end in vicious claws. A bipedal sarrukh has a humanoid upper torso, head, arms, and legs with a snakelike lower torso. The gleaming red eyes of a sarrukh strike fear into the hearts of all other Scaled Ones. Today, thousands of years after the fall of their mighty civilisations, the sarrukh are all but extinct. The few that remain spend their time with hibernation, but when they do interact with the outside world, they usually work to advance the welfare of the creatures they created, which now thrive in their stead.”

  Description		"This reptilian creature stands slightly shorter than a typical human and has roughly human shape and proportions. Its tail measures slightly more than half its body length, and a pronounced fin crowns its head. / Alert, bright, active, curious, and emotional; finheads are good with their hands and willing to perform almost any sort of hard labor. Most see the world in black-and-white terms and believe in absolute concepts such as good, evil, and truth. / Finheads are enthusiastic about new tasks and adventures, and they often leap into dangerous situations before fully understanding them. Even so, their ability to think quickly on their feet allows them to assess situations within moments. Finheads are apt to attack at the drop of a hat if they perceive their foes to be dangerous, particularly loathsome, or evil in some way.”

                        Cold Torpor (Ex): Finheads are warm-blooded creatures, but they retain heat poorly in cold environments. Thus, a finhead takes a -5 penalty on Fortitude saving throws made to avoid nonlethal damage from cold environments, and it takes double the normal amount of nonlethal damage for failing such a saving throw. 
                        Protection from Sonic Attacks (Ex): Because a finhead’s earholes are well protected, it gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws against sonic effects and attacks.
                        Vulnerability to Gas Attacks (Ex): A finhead’s metabolism and reliance on scent make it vulnerable to attacks conveyed through gas, including stinking cloud, cloudkill, and poisonous gas. It thus takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against gas-based effects and attacks.

These primitive wings stretch from its wrists to its waist. / Flyers are the noisiest and most nervous of the saurials, and members of other races often find them somewhat irritating. They love gossip and enjoy spending time with people who are interested in listening them. / Because of its wings, a flyer has difficulty wearing normal clothing, armor, or even a backpack. Thus, their accoutrements are typically custom-made. / Flyers usually act as scouts and messengers in a saurial community, although several important saurial heroes have been flyers. Those that become adventures often do so by accident or out of necessity, since their roles in saurial society often put them in harm’s way.”

                        Lightning Bolt (Su): Two or more kuo-toa cleric (whips) operating together can generate a stroke of lightning every 1d4 rounds. The whips must join hands to launch the bolt but need only remain within 30 feet of one another while it builds. The resulting lightning bolt deals 1d6 points of damage per whip, but a successful Reflex save halves this amount (DC 11 + highest Wisdom modifier among the participating whips + number of whips).
                        Adhesive (Ex): A kuo-toa uses his own body oil and other materials to give his shield a finish almost like flypaper, capable of holding fast any creatures or items that touch it. Any creature that makes a unsuccessful melee attack against a kuo-toa must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 11+kuo-toa’s Con modifier), or the weapon sticks to the shield and is yanked out of its wielder’s grip. A  creature using a natural weapon is automatically grappled if it gets stuck. A kuo-toa requires one hour and special materials costing 20 gp to coat a shield with adhersive, but the secretion remains sticky for up to three days, or until it actually catches something or someone, whichever comes first. Pulling a stuck weapon or limb from a shield requires a DC 20 Strength check.
                        Keen Sight (Ex): A kuo-toa has excellent vision, thanks to his two independently focusing eyes. His eyesight is so keen that he can spot a moving object or creature even if it is invisible or ethereal. Only by remaining perfectly still can such objects or creatures avoid a kuo-toa’s notice.
                        Racial Bonuses: A kuo-toa has a +8 racial bonus on Escape Artist checks and a +4 racial bonus on Search and Spot checks.
                        Slippery (Ex): A kuo-toa secretes an oily film that makes him difficult to grapple or snare. Webs (magically or otherwise) don’t affect kuo-toas, and they usually can wriggle free from most other forms of confinement.

Any equipment the slyth is wearing or carrying transforms to become part of this new form. Material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though the slyth’s Dexterity bonus, deflection bonus, and any armor bonus from force effects (for example, from the mage armor spell) still apply. In her amorphous form, she cannot be flanked or stunned and she is immune to critical hits, but she can’t attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus components. (This limitation does not rule out spells that the slyth may have prepared using the metamagic feats Eschew Materials, Silent Spell, and Still Spell.) The slyth loses all other supernatural abilities while in amorphous form and her magic items cease functioning. Her amorphous form is nearly fluid and boneless, enabling her to pass through holes or narrow openings as small as 2 inches in diameter. Ressuming her normal form is a full-rounded action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. A slyth can remain in amorphous form for up to 10 minutes per class level, but after resuming her normal form she cannot change again for as long as she spent in amorphous form.
                        Immunities (Ex): Because of their shapechanging abilities, slyth are immune to polymorphing and poison.

                        Chitin: A dromite’s skin is hardened, almost like an exoskeleton, and grants the character +3 natural armor to AC and one of the following kinds of resistance to energy: cold 5, electricity 5, sonic 5, or fire 5. The player chooses what type of energy resistance is gained when the character is created. (This choice also dictates which caste the dromite belongs to.) This natural energy resistance stacks with any future energy resistance gained through other effects.
                        Naturally Psionic: Dromite gain 1 bonus power points at 1st level. This benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic class.

Those who pass muster undergo a secret psionic process in one of several hidden elan enclaves, where they abandon their humanity for a new, psionically energized existence. Nonhuman elans are never created, and it could be that the ritual simply doesn’t work for any creatures but those who were originally human. / Because of their exceedingly long life spans sometimes lead the living to think the worst of them, elans practice a certain restraint, especially with regard to the subject of their origin. Otherwise, their personalities vary widely.”

 Name			"Buomman”
 Plural			"Buommans”
 Description		"There might have been a time when the buommans were merely human visitors to the Astral Plane. But now, perhaps hundreds of millennia later, the buommans are neither merely visitors, nor merely human. Known to some astral denizens as the “moaning monks”, buommans dwell in temples and shrines formed by astral debris, which they believe to be the mortal forms of sleeping deities, long forgotten. Buommans are quit, withdrawn, and deferential. They appear more or less like humans, though with long, sagging faces and elongated hands and feet.”

 Name			"Spiker”
 Plural			"Spikers”
 Description		"Spikers hail from Acheron, but scholarly speculation places their origin on the Nine Hells of Baator, the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, or even some unknown metal-based plane. Spikers share a great love of battle. They bravely enter combat, often focusing their attacks on the most dangerous opponent they perceive. / The skin of a spiker is of a dull metallic hue, spotted with patches of metallic spines. A spiker’s eyes are a deep violet and its blood black and oily. Spikers are about as tall as humans but are considerably heavier, with the average weight of 200 pounds. Spikers don’t reach adulthood until past the age of 30, and even the longest-lived among the race don’t survive to see the end of their ninth decade.”

A spiker can deal extra piercing damage on a successful grapple check, or deal piercing damage with a melee attack, as if she wore armor spikes. Because of their spiked skin, spikers have a difficult time wearing armor. The maximum Dexterity bonus of the armor is reduced by 1, and the armor check penalty is worsened by 2. These changes don’t affect the armor’s arcane spell failure changes, nor do they apply to shields used by the spiker.

 Description		"Prowling the darkest forests of Karasuthra, the Beastlands’ lowest layer, wildren build elaborate underground burrows, wich they defend, out of a commingled racial memory, to the death. Often short-tempered and vengeful, wildren generally live solitary lives, emerging only occasionally from their burrows to hunt and to seek mates. The typical wildren looks like a dwarf covered in short, grizzled dark fur, with a broad white stripe of fur running from the bridge of the nose over the top of the head and down to the base of the skull. A wildren’s arms are unnaturally large and well-muscled, and her fingers end in hard claws 2 to 3 inches long. ”

 Name			"Warforged”
 Plural			"Warforged”
 Description		"Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creature—living constructs. / Now that the war has ended, the warforged seek to adapt to life in this era of relative peace. Some.have settled easily into new roles as artisans or laborers, while others wander as adventures or even continue fighting the Last War despite the return of peace. / Warforged appear as massive humanoids molded from a composite of materials—obsidian, iron, stone, darkwood, silver, and organic material—though they move with a surprising grace and flexibility. Warforged have no physical distinction of gender: all of them have a basically muscular, sexless body shape.“

 Special Abilities	Living Construct Subtype (Ex): Warforged are constructs with the living construct subtype. A living construct is a created being giving sentience and free will through powerful and complex creation enchantments. Warforged are living constructs that combine aspects of both constructs and living creatures, as detailed below.
                        Features: As a living construct, a warforged has the following features.
                        --A warforged derives its HD, base attack bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the class it selects.
                        Traits: A warforged possesses the following traits.
                        --Unlike other constructs, a warforged does not have low-light vision or darkvision.
                        --Unlike other constructs, a warforged is not immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities.
                        --Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, sickened, and energy drain.
                        --A warforged cannot heal damage naturally.
                        --Unlike other constructs, a warforged is subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, stunning, ability damage, ability drain, and death effects or necromancy effects.
                        --As living constructs, warforged can be affected by spells that target living creatures as well as by those that target constructs. Damage dealt to a warforged can be healed by cure wounds spells or repair damage spells, and a warforged is vulnerable to disable construct and harm. However, spells from the healing subschool and supernatural abilities that cure hit point damage or ability damage provide only half their normal effect to a warforged.
                        --The unusual physical construction of warforged makes them vulnerable to certain spells and effects that normally don’t affect living creatures. A warforged takes damage from heat metal and chill metal as if he were wearing metal armor. Likewise, a warforged is affected by repel metal or stone as if he were wearing metal armor. A warforged is repelled by repel wood. The iron in the body of a warforged makes him vulnerable to rusting grasp. The creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the spell (Reflex half; save DC 14 + caster’s ability modifier). A warforged takes the same damage from a rust monster’s touch (Reflex DC 17 half). Spells such as stone to flesh, stone shape, warp wood, and wood shape affect objects only, and thus cannot be used on the stone and wood parts of a warforged.
                        --A warforged responds slightly differently from other living creatures when reduced to 0 hit points. A warforged with 0 hit points is disabled, just like a living creature. He can only take a single move action or standard action in each round, but strenuous activity does not risk further injury. When his hit points are less than 0 and greater than -10, a warforged does not lose additional hit points unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature that is stable.
                        --As a living construct, a warforged can be raised or resurrected.
                        --A warforged does not need to eat, sleep, or breathe, but he can still benefit from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as heroes’ feast and potions.
                        --Although living constructs do not need to sleep, a warforged wizard must rest for 8 hours before preparing spells.
                        Composite Plating: The plating used to build a warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a rope, and thus a warforged cannot be enchanted just as armor or magic ropes. Warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The character must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him. / Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5% arcane spell failure change, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure change for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.
                        Light Fortification (Ex): When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a warforged, there is a 25% change that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally,

 Description		"Hengeyokai are intelligent, shapeshifting animals, able to shift freely between human and animal forms, as well as a bipedal, animalistic form. Several subraces exist, defined by the kind of animal form they can assume. / They often display personality traits similar to their animal type—so monkey hengeyokai are curious and inquisitive, hare hengeyokai are peacefully but easily startled, and so on. / In animal form, hengeyokai are almost indistinguishable from normal animals except through magic. Hengeyokai can also assume a bipedal, animalistic (“hybrid”) form. In human form, hengeyokai look exactly like normal humans, though (like lycanthropes) they often display some feature associated with their animal form.“

 Special Abilities	Shapechanger;
                        Altemate Form: Hengeyokai can change shape, assuming one of the three possible forms. This supernatural ability functions like the polymorph other spell, but a hengeyokai can change from a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his character level. Thus, a 1st level hengeyokai can switch from human form to animal form and back again in a single day. Changing form is a full-rounded action that does provoke attacks of opportunity, as with the polymorph self spell. / A hengeyokai’s animal form is a normal animal of Small or smaller size. Possible animal forms include badger, carp, cat, crab, crane, dog, fox, hare, monkey, raccoon dog, rat, sparrow, and weasel. Equipment the hengeyokai is wearing or carrying transforms to become part of the animal form (as with polymorph others), and magic items cease functioning while the hengeyokai remains in animal form. In animal form, the hengeyokai has low-light vision and the supernatural ability to communicate with other animals of its kind. This is the same as a familiar’s ability to speak with animals of its type. Hengeyokai have the size, speed, AC, damage rating, and physical ability scores shown on Table 1-3: Hengeyokai Animal Forms. In animal form, a hengeyokai is effectively disguised as an animal, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks while in this form. / Hengeyokai in hybrid form retain their low-light vision and the ability to communicate with animals of their type. They physical characteristics are based on their abilities in human form, modified as shown on Table 1-2: Hengeyokai Hybrid Form. In this form, a hengeyokai can typically wear light or medium armor without modification, but wearing heavy armor is impossible. Equipment worn or carried by a hengeyokai in human form does not transform when the hengeyokai assumes hybrid form. When a hengeyokai in animal form assumes hybrid form, her equipment returns to its original form and magic items resume function.
