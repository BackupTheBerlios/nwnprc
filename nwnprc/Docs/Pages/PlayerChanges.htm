<p align="left"><font size="2">back to <a href="Player.htm">Players</a>.</font></p>
      
<p align="left">In order to maintain  maximum compatibility and ease of use,
 where possible content has been added,  rather than changed. The PnP Shifter
 class is an example of this; rather than  overwriting Bioware's version,
an alternative was created. However, at some  points it makes sense to replace
 or alter existing content. </p>
      
<p align="left"><b><u>Assassin</u></b></p>
      
<p align="left">In addition to their  normal abilities, assassins now receive
 an extra feat at level 1 designed to  more closely follow the Pen 'n' Paper
 rules for Death Attack.</p>
      
<p align="left">True Death Attack<br>
   Type of feat: Class<br>
   Prerequisite: Level 1 Assassin<br>
   Specifics: After studying your target for 3 rounds, you have 3 rounds
to  slay  them vs DC 10 + Assassin level + Int Mod.<br>
   *Note - using this feat will remove your stealth, you have 6 seconds to
 become  stealthy again in order to continue studying the target. If anybody
 knows a way  around this give me a shout. As per PnP the weapon can only
be melee, so even  though it is possible in code for ranged weapons it is
not included..<br>
   <br>
   How it works: Target (longest range in the game) what you want to kill,
 go  invisible or stealth, move closer into melee range of the target. You
 have to  study the target for 3 rounds(18 seconds), and while studying you
 cant go out of  stealth, or attack. Once the 3 rounds are up your primary
 weapon or gloves if  unarmed are given a temporary Slay Race (race of the
 target) for 3 rounds at the  above DC.</p>
      
<p align="left"><u><b>Arcane Archer</b></u><br>
 </p>
 
<p align="left">This class has had its prerequisites modified to make it more
widely avaliable. Now, instead of "Arcane Spellcasting Level 1", you need
to have at least 1 level in one of the following classes: Sorcerer, Bard,
Wizard, Assasin, and Harper Scout.<br>
 </p>
 
<p align="left"> <u><b>Turn Undead </b></u><br>
  </p>
   
<p align="left">Bioware's Turn Undead script has been replaced with Wes Baran's
 improved Turn Undead script. It is available on the vault <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/scripts/data/1070171824145.shtml">Here</a>.
 It follows the same rules as the bioware script with some critical differences.
 Evil characters that turn undead do not turn or destroy undead, they will
 stun or dominate them. A character can only dominate a number of hit dice
 worth of undead equal to their turning level, any above that will be stunned
 instead. Dominated undead will be freed when their master rests.</p>
   
<p align="left"> </p>
   
<p><u><b>Power Attack / Improved Power Attack</b></u></p>
    
<p align="left">These have been separated into sub-radials so you can select 
 exactly which degree of accuracy/power trade-off you wish.<br>

<p align="left"><u><b>Epic Spells</b></u></p>
      
<p align="left" style="margin-left: 25px;">The PRC now contains Boneshank's
 Epic  Spellcasting System. As part of this all of the Bioware Epic Spells
 have been  re-written and added to, though the Bioware spells have the same
 name and  effects.</p>
