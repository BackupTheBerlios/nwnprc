<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>This is a collection of common problems
 and misunderstandings that have accumulated on the PRC forums over time.
It covers a lot of things that should be obvious, things that are hardcoded,
 and things that will never be done. There are some groups of questions relating 
to the same subject. These are:<br>

<p align="left"><u><b><a name="PnP_Shifter"></a>PnP Shifter</b></u><br>
 </p>
 
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big> Q How do I use the PnP Shifter
to change shape?<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A To change into a form: <br>
  Use the Greater Wildshape or Epic Greater Wildshape class feats. <br>
  This will summon a speck of light at the location targeted.<br>
  Talk to this light.<br>
  You will be given a list of possible forms.<br>
  Select a form to shift into it.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q How do I gain new forms?<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A Use the mimic feat on a creature.
 This will add them to your list of known creatures and automatically shift
 you into that shape as if you had used Greater Wildshape.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q I can not become a Fey or Shapechanger<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A As per PnP rules, shifters cannot
 assume these forms.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q Before I shift I have 10 strength. I shift into a dragon, so I should 
have 30+ strength. However, I only have 22! What's happening?!<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A This is because there is a Bioware
 limit of +12 to any ability score and +30 to any skill. Nothing we can do
 about this you will just have to build accordingly.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><br>
Q I shifted into a form with special powers, but I don't have those powers,
what happened?<br>
</p>
<p align="left">A Only Epic Wild Shape will give you the special abilities
of the original. To use those powers, use the Spark Of Life item (this can
be put into quickslots).<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q I shifted into a chicken (or other small animal) and got invisibility.
Is  that supposed to happen?<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A Yes. This represents the fact
that noone looks twice at yet another rat running around the dungeon. It
happens whenever you select a form with a CR less than 1.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q When I shift into a form with a slow movement rate, I remain slow when
 I shift back.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A Bioware bug. Either save/reload
 or shift into a zombie form.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big><br>
  Q If I shift into a dynamic model (i.e. one that changes its armor) that
 is not the same as my normal model, I get visual weirdness.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
   
<p align="left"><big><font size="2"><big>A Bioware bug. Not a lot we can
do to work around it, just avoid those forms.<br>
  </big></font></big></p>
  <br>
Q I mimic a creature and change into it. Yet when I try to change back into
that form later it says I need more levels / its a different form / it has
different atributes.<br>
Q Why can I only select certain forms in specific modules?<br>
<br>
A This is a side effect of the way that the Shifter works. When you first
mimic a creature, it copies the attributes of that specific creature. Later,
when you want to shift back into that form, the original may not be around.
Instead it creates a copy using the same blueprint and uses the attributes
of the copy instead. However, the original may not have been the same as
the blueprint, and so the attributes may not be the same. For example [minor
spoiler] the HotU makers islands adamatium golem is several levels lower
than the blueprint so the shifter may be able to mimic that creature but
not have the levels to shift back into that form later. [end of spoiler].
As part of this, if a blueprint is specific to that module, that form will
not be avaliable in other modules.<br>

<br>
Q Whenever I try to load chaper 2 of the Hordes of the Underdark, the game
crashes. Whats going on?<br>
<br>
A It is not entirely clear what causes this error, but several people have
reported that defragmenting their hard drives allows them to continue. Don't
ask why, we dont know! It may take several minutes for the module to load,
so make sure to allow it enough time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q I gained a level in Lich, but dont have any of the bonuses.<br>
<br>
A Your real Lich level is the lower of either your number of class levels
or the number of times you have upgraded you phylatery.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q How do I create / upgrade my Phylactery?<br>
<br>
A Use the Craft Lich Items feat to summon the Lich Crafting placeable. Talk
to the placeable and you should have the option to create&nbsp;/ upgrade
your phylactery. Make sure you have enough gold (40,000) and XP (1,600) to
pay for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q How do I become a Demi-Lich?<br>
<br>
A There are several requirements. Before you can start you must be an Epic
Character and have 5 levels in Lich. Then you must create at least 1 Soul
Gem per level (see next question) and upgrade your phylactery. You can't
upgrade your phylactery if you do not have enough Soul Gems. The final level
of Demi-Lich requires 8 soul gems, not 5.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q How do I create Soul Gems?<br>
<br>
A In a similar way to upgrading your phylactery. However, you must first
have 21+ levels in Wizard, Sorcerer, or Cleric and have 5+ levels in Lich.
Each soul gem costs 120,000 gold and 4,800 XP.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q My Fear Aura disaperred. Help!<br>
<br>
A This is a Bioware Bug. Auras can become invisible when you cross areas,
though they are still active. They can also become separated from you when
you reload a saved game. Just disable and reactivate the aura.<br>
<br>
<br>
Q The Lich is massivly overpowered! A level 10 Demi-Lich gets +20 to Hide,
Listen, Move Silently, Search,  Persuade, and Spot; Damage Reduction 30/+20;
Damage Resistance 20 to acid,  fire, and sonic; Turn Resistance +20;&nbsp;
Immunity to Level 9 spells and below; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
+10. Plus other items!<br>
<br>
A It is very powerful, but to become a level 10 lich, you must spend 40,000
x 10 = &nbsp;400,000 gold and 1,600 x 10 = 16,000 XP on your phylactery,
plus 120,000 x 8 = 960,000 gold and 4,800 x 8 = 38,400 XP on Soul Gems for
a total of &nbsp;1,360,000 gold and 54,400 XP. Plus you have some of the
downsides of being undead; can be turned (with difficulty), vulnerable to
anti-undead spells, normal healing doesn't work. Also you gain no BAB, few
skills, few hit points, no spellcasting bonuses, and no saving throw increases
for those 10 levels. Remeber too that item-based bonuses do not generally
stack, so if you have a ring of Damage Reduction 10/+3 it not that useful
to a level 10 Lich.<br>
