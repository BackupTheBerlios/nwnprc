    Included in the PRC pack are two new skills, Iaijatsu Focus and Jump. 
<br>
 Iaijatsu Focus is used both as a pre-requisite and as a used skill for the 
Iaijatsu Master prestige class. <br>
 Jump is used as a prerequisite for the Initiate of Draconic Mysteries prestigice 
class.<br>

class description. There are a few feats which can be used by many classes,
 often as prerequisites for some of the prestige classes. These are listed
