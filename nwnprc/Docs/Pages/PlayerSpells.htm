<p align="left">There is a total of 75+  new spells in the PRC for various 
casters. They are however, not available on  scrolls or items in a module 
unless the module builder has added them. They can  still be selected when 
gaining a new level. For a complete listing of all  new spells, complete
with descriptions and the innate levels, <a

 showing which level each class gains the new spells at,  <a

<p align="left">Also included in the PRC is Boneshanks <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/hakpacks/data/1075246451500.shtml">Epic 
 Spellcasting System. </a></p>
    
<p align="left"><b><u>This is a builder based system, meaning that it will 
only  work in module that is designed to work with it. </u></b></p>
    
<p align="left">The system itself works quite seamlessly. All the spells are
 based upon certain spell Seeds, (such as Energy, Armor, etc) and to gain
a seed  a caster needs to find a book containing information on that Seed.
The book is  then used via a Unique Power property, and a feat is added to
the character.  This feat shows in the character sheet, so a player can tell
what Seeds they do  and do not know.</p>
    
<p align="left">Once a player has some Seeds, they need to find a Spell Book. 
 There is one spell book per epic spell, each spell book has a Unique Power 
 property which will tell the player what the effects of the spell are, what 
 seeds it requires, and what difficulty it is. The more powerful spells have 
a  harder DC (Difficulty Check) associated with them, ranging from the mid 
20's, to  over 100. Some feats can reduce the DC of a spell, for example
a School Focus  feat decreases the DC of epic spells from that school.</p>
    
<p align="left">When a player has a Spell Book, they have to research the 
spell.  To research a spell, place the spell book onto a research lab (or 
an altar, or  whatever the builder has designed). All spells cost an amount 
of gold and XP to  research, this is proportional to the DC of the spell. 
If the player has the  required seeds, enough gold and XP, they will make 
a spellcraft check against  the DC of the spell. If this is successful, the 
gold and XP is lost and the  player gains a "researched spell" feat. If the 
check is unsuccessful, the player  looses a proportion of the gold, and none 
of the XP.</p>
    
<p align="left">After a spell has been successfully researched, the caster 
needs  to place it onto their epic spell radial. To allow this, when resting 
a  conversation will appear with an option to change epic spell radials. This
can  be accessed at any time outside of combat, and you do not have to rest
to change  your epic spells. One restriction however, is that you cannot
have more than 7  spells on the radial. This is a Bioware bug, nothing we
can do about it!</p>
    
<p align="left">When you rest, you refresh a number of Epic Spell Slots equal 
to  your lore skill divided by 10 (rounding down).  To cast a spell, simply 
 select it from the radial. After the spell has been cast and the projectile 
 impacts, you will have to make a spellcraft check against the DC of the spell.
 If you succeed, the spell takes effect, if you fail, they spell is wasted.
 Whenever you attempt to cast a spell, successfully or not, you use up one
of  your Epic Spell Slots for that day. </p>
