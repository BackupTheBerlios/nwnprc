<p align="left"> </p>
   
<p align="left">Thank you for downloading the Player Resource Consortium (PRC).
 There are several important things you should note <b>before</b> using this
package.</p>
   
<p align="left"> </p>
   
<p align="center"><u><b>NOTE 1</b></u></p>
     
<p align="left">The PRC pack   <span
 style="text-transform: uppercase; font-weight: 700;">requires</span> both 
   expansions (Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark) to be installed.  
   They must be installed using Bioware’s normal installation procedure, they
<b>CANNOT</b> be installed by just copying the files    to your hard drive.
If the setup program complains that expansions are missing    and you have
actually installed both expansions using Bioware's setup    programs, then
most likely your registry entries have become corrupted and you    will need
to reinstall the expansions.</p>
     
<p align="left">You should also be running the latest Neverwinter Nights 
  patch, 1.62 at the time of writing this.  Without the latest patch, some 
   functions may not work correctly.</p>
 
<p align="left"> </p>
   
<p align="center"><u><b>NOTE 2</b></u></p>
     
<p align="left">The PRC is available in two installation packages; the   
recommended, easy-to-use exe package, and the more flexible rar    package.</p>
     
<p align="left">Exe: This will automatically extract all the files to the 
   correct directories.  When finished it can also show you this Readme and 
start the Module    Updater. Under windows, it will make an Add/Remove Programs 
   entry for simpler uninstallation. It is available from   <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/hakpacks/data/1071643329920.shtml">Here</a>.
 The downside is that the exe extractor requires Microsoft's .NET Framework
v1.1,  available through Windows Update, or direct from the Microsoft site
  <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3&amp;disp">
   Here</a>.</p>
     
<p align="left">Rar: For those that don't know, rar is a compression format, 
similar    to (but better than) zip. To extract it you will need a program 
such as   <a href="http://www.rarlabs.com/">WinRAR</a>; Winzip may not do 
the job    properly. You will have to manually put the ".hak" files into the
hak folder,    ".tlk" files in the tlk folder, and the ".erf" files in the
erf folder    (creating the folders if they do not exist). The ".hif" file
is used by the    Module Updater, which is also included. The ".hif" file
should go into the hak    folder. The rar package is available from   <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/hakpacks/data/1082946089000.shtml">Here</a>.</p>
 
<p align="left"> </p>
   
<p align="center"><u><b>NOTE 3</b></u></p>
     
<p align="left">Packaged with the PRC is bleedingedge's excellent   <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1076838606000.shtml">Module 
   Updater</a>. This is a separate program that can automatically add custom 
   content, such as the PRC, to a module and perform laborious tasks such 
as 2da    merging. This requires Microsoft's .NET Framework v1.1, available
either through    Windows Update in the non-critical section, or direct from
the Microsoft site   <a
 href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3&amp;disp">
   Here</a>. <b>The module updater and the exe extractor are the only files
that requires .NET.</b>  If you do not wish to install    .NET, or if you
cannot (because you are using Linux for example) you can still    use the
PRC; you will however have to install the PRC by hand into any module   
you wish to use it in.</p>
     
<p align="left">When using bleedingedge's   <a
 href="http://nwvault.ign.com/Files/other/data/1076838606000.shtml">Module 
   Updater</a> please note a few    points:</p>
     
<ul>
      <li>          
    <p align="left"><b>Backup your modules first.</b> It does generate a
.backupmod      file, but you can never be too safe!</p>
   </li>
   <li>          
    <p align="left">In some cases, a perfect merge may not be possible and 
an      error message will display. This is probably due to conflicting 2da 
entries.      In many cases, this may not cause a severe problem. The best 
way to tell is      to <b>backup</b> and test.     </p>
   </li>
   <li>          
    <p align="left">Rarely, the Module Updater will be successful yet there 
will      still be bugs in the module caused by the interaction of the PRC 
with other      components of the module. Again, the best way to work with 
this is to <b>     backup</b> and test.     </p>
   </li>
   <li>          
    <p align="left">Once again: <b>Backup your modules first!</b></p>
   </li>
 
</ul>

<p align="left">Now that the critical notes have gone, the best way to get 
used  to the PRC is to dive in. Bellow is a 3-step guide to installing the 
PRC on the  original campaigns.</p>
   
<p align="left">1. Backup all the .nwm files in the nwm directory to another 
safe  location.</p>
   
<p align="left">2. Run the Module Updater on the original campaign modules 
 (NOT on the backups!)</p>
   
<p align="left">3. Start a new  character in the campaign of your choice! 
</p>

<p align="left">The rest of the documentation is split into 3 main parts:</p>
     
<p>1. For <a href="Pages/Player.htm">Players</a>.</p>
     
<p>2. For Servers. </p>
     
<p>3. For <a href="Pages/Builder.htm">Builders</a>. </p>
     
<p> </p>
     
<p>The players file contains details of what each new class / spell / feat
 /  etc does. Also answers common problems and misunderstandings, as well
as some  suggested builds and tactics to make the most of the new features.</p>
     
<p>The servers file is information targeted at those who run a Persistent
 World,  or other server, that uses the PRC. Details of possible problems
and issues,  both about balance and performance. DMs may also find valuable
information here.</p>
     
<p>The builders file include tips for builders about what the files are and
 do,  suggestions for incorporating the PRC into the rest of a module, and
 information  on creating new prestige classes. There are also some alternative
 feature  implementations.</p>
