    Defensive Rebuke

    Devoted Spirit (Boost)
    Level: Crusader 3
    Prerequisite: One Devoted Spirit maneuver.
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift Action
    Range: Personal
    Target: You
    Duration: 1 round

    You sweep your weapon in a wide, deadly arc. When your blows strike home, you
    send your foe tumbling back on the defensive. He must deal with you first, or 
    leave himself open to your deadly counter.
    
    You make an attack of opportunity against any foe you strike this round
    who targets your allies instead of attacking you.
