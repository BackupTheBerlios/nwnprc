    Iron Guard's Glare

    Devoted Spirit (Stance)
    Level: Crusader 1
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift Action
    Range: Personal.
    Target: You.
    Duration: Stance.

    With a quick snarl and a glare that would stop a charging barbarian in his tracks,
    you spoil an opponent's attack. Rather than strike his original target, your enemy
    turns his attention to you.
    
    Any creature you threaten takes a -4 penalty on attacks against allies.
    (Mechnical implementation: AoE that grants allies +4 Dodge AC when they are in it).
