    Immortal Fortitude

    Devoted Spirit (Stance)
    Level: Crusader 8
    Prerequisite: Three Devoted Spirit maneuvers
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift Action
    Range: Personal
    Target: You
    Duration: Stance

    Despite the horrific wounds you suffer, the flash of searing spells and the crash of a foe's
    mighty attacks, you stand resolute on the field. So long as the potential for victory exists
    you fight on.
    
    While you remain in this stance, you cannot be killed through loss of hitpoints. Other effects,
    such as death spells, may still kill you. If you take damage that would reduce you below 0 hit points,
    you must make a Fortitude save or die. If you succeed, you have 1 hit point remaining. After enduring
    three saves, the stance ends.
