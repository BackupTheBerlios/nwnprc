    Desert Wind (Boost)
    Level: Swordsage 2
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift action
    Range: Personal
    Target: You
    Duration: End of Turn

    Your weapon transforms into a roaring gout of flame. As you swing your 
    burning blade, it stretches out beyond your normal reach to scorch your foes.
    
    You take a full attack action, with your reach increasing by 5 feet.
    Your weapon deals fire damage instead of normal damage for this round.
    This is a supernatural maneuver.
