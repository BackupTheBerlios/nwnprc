    Lightning Recovery

    Iron Heart (Counter)
    Level: Warblade 4
    Prerequisite: Two Iron Heart Maneuvers
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift Action
    Range: Melee Attack
    Target: One Creature

    Your foe twists out of the way of your initial attack, but your weapon becomes a blur as 
    you reverse direction and strike at him again with lightning speed. In the blink of an
    eye, you complete your attack and resume your defensive posture.
    
    Make a single attack with a +2 bonus on the attack roll.
