    Feigned Opening

    Setting Sun (Counter)
    Level: Swordsage 3
    Prerequisite: One Setting Sun maneuver.
    Initiation Action: 1 Swift Action
    Range: Melee.
    Target: One Creature.

    You show your opponent a seemingly fatal mistake in your defenses, but easily avoid
    the ensuing attack and simultaneously draw your foe into overextending. As she fights
    to regain her balance, you make a swift counterattack.
    
    You provoke an attack of opportunity from a creature. If it misses, you get an attack against
    the creature. If it hits, all of your allies who threaten that creature can make an attack against it.
