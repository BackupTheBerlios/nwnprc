    Pouncing Charge

    Tiger Claw (Strike)
    Level: Swordsage 5, Warblade 5
    Prerequisite: Two Tiger Claw maneuvers
    Initiation Action: 1 Full-round action
    Range: Personal
    Target: You

    With the roar of a wild beast, you throw yourself into the fray.
    Your weapons are little more than a blur as you hack at your foe with feral speed.
    
    You charge your foe, but instead of performing a single attack at the end of the charge,
    you perform a full attack.
