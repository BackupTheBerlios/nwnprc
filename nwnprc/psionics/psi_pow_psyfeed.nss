    Psychofeedback

    Psychometabolism
    Level: Egoist 5, Psychic Warrior 5
    Manifesting Time: 1 standard action
    Range: Personal
    Target: You
    Duration: 1 Round/level
    Power Points: 9
    Metapsionics: Extend
   
    You can readjust your body to boost one physical ability score at the expense of one or more other scores. Select one ability 
    score you would like to boost, and increase it by the same amount that you decrease one or more other scores. All score 
    decreases are treated as a special form of ability damage, called ability burn, which cannot be magically or psionically healed
    - it goes away only through natural healing.

    You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score by an amount equal to your manifester level (or any lesser amount), 
    assuming you can afford to burn your other ability scores to such an extent.

    When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost also ends, but your ability burn remains until it is healed naturally.
