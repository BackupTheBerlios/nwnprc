/*
prc_bab_caller

This is a function to evaluate and apply SetBaseAttackBonus
after taking all the PRC sources into account and choosing one appropriately

Run from prc_inc_function EvalPRCFeats()

as of PRC 3.1c EvalPRCFeats() is called on Equip / Unequip and level up events
prc_bab_caller is occasionally called from other sources (such as casting tensers or divine power)
