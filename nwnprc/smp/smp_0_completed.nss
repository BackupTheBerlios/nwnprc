Unfinished Script:
----------------------------------------------

Alter Self - Needs some appearace changing and the setup conversation finished.
Analyze Dweomer - Definately needs some major work mechanics wise, or simplifying of the spell.
Animal Shapes - Polymorph based. Need constants/Polymorph.2da entries.
Animal Trance - Concentration. Also not got the effect of animals following a person.
Animate Dead - Hard script to do without doing a new death system for various things, editing AI etc.
Animate Objects - Need to sort out what creatures we can animate. Need to add new appearance.2da lines, like the chest and APPEARANCE_TYPE_OBJECT_CANDLE.
Animate Plants - as above animate objects.
Arcane Eye - Basically, creates an eye which you can look out of. Kind of possible. Coolish spell for scouting too!
Arcane Mark - Fun little spell, and quite easy. If we create a placable with a visual effect on (or not) it'd work.
Arcane Sight - Needs some like Analyze Dweomer and Detect Magic.

--------------
Might be impossible:
--------------

Antipathy - very/quite hard. This might well be not worth it, but is a neat little (9th level) spell.
Arcane Lock - reworking the entire locking inbuilt system might not be worth it in the slightest.


----------------------------------------------
Noted as impossible for some reason:
----------------------------------------------

Animal Growth - Need physical changes (growing of an animal).
Antimagic Field - bah! without any "supression" functions, at all, this is in one word: Impossible.
