    sp_nondetection

    Abjuration
    Level: Rgr 4, Sor/Wiz 3, Trickery 3
    Components: V, S, M
    Casting Time: 1 standard action
    Range: Touch
    Target: Creature or object touched
    Duration: 1 hour/level
    Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object)
    Spell Resistance: Yes (harmless, object)
    The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal balls. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.
    If cast on a creature, nondetection wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.
    Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.
