/**@file Solid Fog
Conjuration (Creation)
Level: Sor/Wiz 4, Hexblade 4
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 min./level
Spell Resistance: No

This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition
to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that 
any creature attempting to move through it progresses
at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed,
and it takes a -2 penalty on all melee attack and 
melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective 
ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the
like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog
is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it 
passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A 
creature can�t take a 5-foot step while in solid fog.

However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind 
(31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 
1 round.

Solid fog can be made permanent with a permanency 
spell. A permanent solid fog dispersed by wind 
reforms in 10 minutes.

Material Component: A pinch of dried, powdered peas 
                    combined with powdered animal hoof.
