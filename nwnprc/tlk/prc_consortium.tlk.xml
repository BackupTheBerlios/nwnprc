Each beholder believes that it represents a state of true perfection. Among the desperate wastrels of decadent cities and debased explorers of the subterranean Underdark can be found humanoids who agree, and who have entered into a surgical pact with the beholder race in an attempt to achieve even a sliver of that perfection. These so-called Ocular Adepts, outcasts to their own societies, have pledged their services to one or more eye tyrants and pledged their religious devotion to the alien entity known as the Great Mother, the deity matron of all beholders.

Dwarven Battleragers, or kuldjargh (axe idiots), are legendary berserker warriors who can enter a battle frenzy through ritualistic singing. They are believed to have been touched by the dwarven gods of battle, who taught them that if they die in battle, they will return stronger than before as a just reward. Therefore, they have no fear of death. Battleragers command a grudging, if fearful, respect within dwarven society, where they are known to have coined such philosophically complex dwarven maxims like "head first" and "if it moves, kill it." Most live short, glorious lives.

Description: This spell causes the subject's outline to appear blurred. This distortion grants one-half concealment (i.e. 20% miss chance). A see-invisibility spell does not counteract the blur effect, but a true-seeing spell does.</entry>

Description: This spell causes a pale glow to surround and outline the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures loose the benefit from the concealment normally caused by darkness, blur, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures. The faerie fire can be blue, red, or violet, at random. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.</entry>

Mage Killers are a rare breed. They master magic designed for combat against other spellcasters. They learn not only combat skills as might be taught a warrior, but also spells that target the weaknesses of their foes. Some use traps, others use weapons, but all hone their magical skills to a fine point, for it is those skills that distinguish them from the usual run of hunters and killers. They develop friendships with the sorts of people who can lead them to their foes, but they place the dirty business of overcoming those foes on their own shoulders.

Wizards and sorcerers have been part of the Harpers since the organization's inception. Many of its senior members today are powerful mages. Among the organizations principal allies are several influential wizards and sorcerers who have made some of their accumulated knowledge available to the Harpers. Mystra, the deity of magic, is one of the patron deities of the Harpers; her predecessor was one of the deities who met at the Dancing Place centuries ago to inspire the founding of the organization. With such a rich magical tradition, it is inevitable that the Harpers would develop some of their own magical lore and techniques to pass on to their agents.

The dream of melding magic and weapon play is fulfilled in the person of the Spellsword. A student of both arcane rituals and martial techniques, the Spellsword gradually learns to cast spells in armor with less chance of failure. Moreover, she can cast spells through her weapon, as well as store spells there for later use. Feared by mages for her ability to cast in armor and by the common people for her ability to use spells, the Spellsword often walks the world alone.

  <entry id="45130" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
The Master of Shrouds is an evil spellcaster who magically seizes incorporeal undead and sets them to do her bidding. The wrathful undead spread fear and death as they vent their anger at being disturbed. While a Master of Shrouds has some divine spells, her primary tool is the ability to summon incorporeal undead creatures to serve her. Evil clerics most often become Masters of Shrouds, though ex-paladins may do so if they turn far enough from their lawful good roots and gain access to one of the required domains.

- Hit Dice: d8.
- Proficiencies: Masters of Shrouds are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields.
- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.

Skills: Concentration 10 ranks, Spellcraft 10 ranks.
Spells: Ability to cast divine spells, and access to at least one of these domains: Death, Evil, Protection

The Red Wizards are the masters of Thay, the conquerors of that land's native Rashemi, and the would-be magical overlords of Faerun. They focus on a school of magic more intently than any specialist, achieving incredible mastery of magic within a very narrow focus. Seen as cruel and evil tyrants by people across Toril, a few choose to leave their region, assume secret identities, and practice magic without having to worry about political alliances and possible slave uprisings. Early in their careers, would-be Red Wizards specialize in a school of magic and acquire the Tattoo Focus feat that prepares them for entry into the Red Wizards of Thay. All Red Wizards have some skill as a specialist wizard, and most follow that path exclusively, but a few dabble in other sorts of learning, such as combat or divine magic. While it is possible for a sorcerer or a bard to become a Red Wizard, such misfits are ridiculed in their homeland and are incredibly rare.

Something beckons, and you are drawn up out of the endless gray swirl, happy to leave your final fate undecided. A swirl of color streaks towards you, enveloping, bathing you. you have come back!

You can feel it reenergizing every particle of your form, flushing death from you and leaving life in its place. It is thick and warm, and you greedily embrace it.

While many view the Fists of Hextor simply as effective if brutal mercenaries, they are in fact templars sworn to the service of their unforgiving deity. The world is a dark and unforgiving place, or so says the Church of Hextor, wherein the strong survive by ruling the weak and forging order from the chaos. To support its dogma, the Church established this elite company of templars and made them available to hire to those whose cause complemented the Church's ultimate goals (and who could, naturally, afford to pay the hefty tithes necessary to maintain a crack unit of well-armed and well-trained men and women). The Fists are infamous for their efficient brutality: Nowhere will an employer in need of military aid locate mercenaries more dedicated to ensuring that the rule of law prevails over the forces of anarchy and chaos.

These knights are members of the Stargazers organization. Once ordained, Knights of the Middle Circle accept strict demands for their allegiance and obedience and undertake many important duties. They provide security for Stargazer chapterhouses and may be called upon for similar service for allies of the Stargazers. Since the Stargazers welcome members of any class to their ranks, the Knights of the Middle Circle often deliver membership invitations to honorable, good adventurers or expert astronomers who have served the Outer Circle for several years. The knights often offer missions and quests to Outer Circle adventurers, and occasionally lead such adventures. If a mission is too important for those not sworn to the Stargazers to know of, Knights of the Middle Circle may be assigned to work on it secretly under the cover of some more obvious activity.

The famous Purple Dragons of Cormyr are regarded across Faerun as exemplars of disciplined, skilled, loyal soldiers. Their reputation is deserved partly because of the heroic actions of their leaders, the Purple Dragon Knights. Purple Dragon Knights develop uncanny skills relating to coordinating and leading soldiers. Most are fighters, rangers or paladins, but a few bards, clerics, and rogues have been known to become Purple Dragon Knights. Sorcerers and Wizards tend to join the War Wizards, Cormyr's elite brigade of fighting spellcasters, while barbarians are too undisciplined, and druids and monks too "uncivilized" in Cormyr to enter this career.

Many armies boast units of soldiers who use a bow as their primary weapon, but most do not possess the discipline to gain the kind of experience the Peerless Archer has. The Peerless Archer devotes his life to perfecting his skill with the bow. All other concerns are secondary. For him, the perfect moment in life occurs when the arrow is loosed and everything depends upon the accuracy of his eye, the steadiness of his hand, and his understanding of his chosen weapon. For the most skilled archers, life is lived to its fullest in that moment. Perfection is a bulls-eye, and everything else is irrelevant.

The Duelist is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. Also known as the swashbuckler, the Duelist always takes full advantage of his quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, Duelists feel that the best way to protect themselves is to not get hit at all.

- Hit Die: d10
- Proficiencies: A Duelist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, but does not gain any armor or shield proficiencies.
- Skill Points: 4 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Base Attack Bonus: +6
Feats: Dodge, Weapon Finesse, Mobility, Weapon Proficiency (Martial, Rogue or Elf).
Skills: Tumble 5 ranks. Perform 3 ranks.

ABILITIES:

Level
 1: Canny Defense - Dodge bonus to AC based on intelligence bonus, limited by class level.
 2: Thug - +2 initiative, +2 Persuade
 3: Spring Attack - No longer incurs Attacks of Opportunity for moving in combat.
 4: Grace - +2 Bonus to reflex saves.
 5: Precise Strike +1d4 - Bonus damage while wielding a light piercing weapon.
 6: Acrobatic Attack +2 - +2 attack and damage by jumping at enemy.
 7: Elaborate Parry - Bonus to Parry Skill or Armor Class.
 8: Improved Initiative
 9: Deflect Arrows
10: Precise Strike +2d4

NOTES:

Duelist loses Canny Defense, Precise Strike, and Grace while wearing any armor or shield.

Could not implement PnP's Improved Reaction, +2 bonus to initiative. So I gave them the Thug feat, as it is the closes thing to it.

Could not implement PnP's Enhanced Mobility, +4 AC vs. Attacks of Opportunity. That bonus would stack with mobility... I gave them Spring Attack instead as that was the closest thing to it.

  <entry id="45650" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
A mortal imbued with fiendish cruelty, the drow judicator is a knight most foul. This unholy warrior is steeped in the divine energy of Selvetarm, the Spider That Waits, self-appointed Champion of Lolth. Consort of demons and demonic arachnids, the drow judicator is hated and feared by all, especially other male drow who are jealous of the heights of power to which he has risen. Drow judicators must make an unholy pledge to Selvetarm and then survive the rites of entry to adopt the prestige class. At least a little schooling in spellcasting is required, but only the toughest and meanest sorcerers and wizards can survive the entry requirements.

-Hit Die: d8.

  <entry id="45695" lang="en" sex="m">Psionic Feats</entry>
  <entry id="45696" lang="en" sex="m">Psionic feats are only available to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers. (In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have psi-like abilities.)
Possessing the feat Wild Talent also qualifies one for these feats.

Due to technical reasons, we cannot enforce this limitation directly. If you do take one of these feats without qualifying for it, you will be re-leveled.</entry>
  <entry id="45697" lang="en" sex="m">Metapsionic Feats</entry>
  <entry id="45698" lang="en" sex="m">As a manifesters knowledge of psionics grows, he can learn to manifest powers in ways sligtly different from how the powers were originally designed or learned. For example, a manifester can learn how to manifest a power so that it lasts longer than normal, deals more damage than normal, or is improved in some other way. Of course, manifesting a power while using a metapsionic feat is more expensive than manifesting the power normally.
  Manifesting Time: Powers manifested using metapsionic feats take the same time as manifesting the powers normally unless the feat description specifically says otherwise, such as with Quicken Power.
  Manifestation Cost: To use a metapsionic feat, a psionic character must both expend his psionic focus and pay an increased power point cost as given in the feat description. For example, applying the Chain Power feat to a power increases the power's cost by 6 power points.
  Limits on Use: As with all powers, you cannot spend more power points on a power than your manifester level. Metapsionic feats merely let you manifest powers in different ways; they do not let you violate this rule.
  Effects of Metapsionic Feats on a Power: In all ways, a metapsionic power operates at it's original power level, even though it costs additional power points. The modifications to a power made by a metapsionic feat have only their noted effect on the power. A manifester can't use a metapsionic feat to alter a power being cast from a power stone, dorje, or other device.
Manifesting a power modified by the Quicken Power feat does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Some metapsionic feats apply only to certain powers, as described in each specific feat entry.</entry>

Some people just like to fight. Whether it be in a pub, defending a friend's honor, or in a back alley, robbing an old man, a brawler's primary ability is using his fists to bludgeon his enemies senseless. Some become professionals, fighting in sports events for money and fame. Others remain largely unknown, fighting for the sheer pleasure of it. Yet others become adventurers, realizing their talents can be used on monsters as well. All brawlers share one thing in common: a preference for fighting with their fists. However, they can still pick up weapons and swing them with awesome efficiency, making them deadly combatants.

Brawler Fists: A brawler's fists do more damage than a normal character's, but only when fighting without weapons or a shield. In addition, the strengthening of the flesh and bone of the hand caused by constantly punching hard things has given them the ability to pierce through damage resistance, starting at level 6.

NOTE: If multiclassed with a monk, the character will use whichever unarmed damage is better. It does not stack. In addition, taking a level in monk disables the use of certain brawler bonus feats (see below.)

Across the world, bards are considered to be jacks-of-all-trades, but sometimes they find themselves hard-pressed to be effective warriors. As a result, a few bards seek out The Society of the Edge, a group of like-minded individuals who desire to be able to fare better in the heat of combat. Members of the Society of the Edge are taught many abilities that are well-suited to battle. However, bards are also artistically-minded individuals, and thus study under the Society does not stop at combat training. Following the traditions of warrior bards of times past, Minstrels of the Edge learn many musical pieces which can affect the abilities and moods of their allies and enemies alike.

Light Armor Spellcasting: The Minstrel of the Edge does not suffer from arcane spell failure when wearing light armor. However, arcane spell failure from medium or heavy armor or shields still applies.

Minstrel Song: Starting at level 2 and every two levels thereafter, the Minstrel of the Edge can learn a Minstrel Song. These songs are performed much like Bard Songs, but have different effects. Minstrel Songs count as Bard Songs in terms of uses per day. Only one Minstrel Song can be performed at a time. However, a Minstrel can have three song effects at a time: one Minstrel Song, one Bard Song, and one Curse Song.

Greater Minstrel Song: The Minstrel of the Edge has become even more proficient at mixing the musical phrases in his songs. This is done by fusing multiple themes into the Bardic music  the Minstrel can sing a song that inspires courage in allies and also lulls enemies to sleep. The Minstrel can now perform up to two Minstrel Songs at a time, in addition to his Bard Song and Curse Song.

While many performing bards worship Milil, few of them have the religious devotion to become one of his clergy. However, all of the leaders of his church were also trained as musicians in some form or another. While this does not mean all of them have pursued the path of the bard, those that have often hold positions of greater authority in the church. A few of these Milil selects for his own members with enough spiritual tenacity and ability in the musical arts to attract his favor. These Favored of Milil are renowned for their musical ability, because of its divine presence. Not only does their music cause inspiration in their allies, the very notes are laced with divine power granted by Milil himself.

A Shifter has no form they call their own. Instead, they cloth themselves in whatever shape is most expedient at the time. While others base their identities largely on their external forms, the Shifter actually comes closer to their true self through all of their transformations. Of necessity, their sense of self is based not on their outward form, but on their soul, which is truly the only constant about them. It is the inner strength of that soul that enables them to take on any shape and remain themselves within.

(This version was created more closely to PnP guidelines. All available forms can be shifted into via verbal commands. The list of available creatures is here: http://www.nwnlexicon.com/compiled/other.resource.html Essentially, everything.)
Special thanks to Brian Greinke for his additions:
True Epic Monster Powers,
Greater Wild Shape and Epic Greater Wild Shape now require you to have already mimicked the form you want to become.

10: Evershifting form - No limit on Mimic or Greater Wildshape.

Epic Shifter
The epic Shifter has gone beyond the normal druidic ability to wildshape; no longer does she simply assume a new form when she changes shape. The epic Shifter actually becomes the new creature. Epic Shifters are rarely encountered in their true form; indeed, some of the most ancient and powerful Shifters claim (with some pride) to have forgotten their true form entirely.

Epic Shifters are generally a wild and carefree lot, and they prefer to spend their time exploring the multiverse and reveling in new forms and shapes they discover along the way.

While the Red Wizards of Thay are not opposed to blasting their opponents with deadly spells or shredding the minds of their enemies with dark magic, there are times when they need protectors who have mastered the art of swordplay. These protectors are the Thayan Knights, familiar with magic, and loyal to none but the tattooed mages. The Thayan Knights act as bodyguards and enforcers for the Red Wizards. They lead common Thayan troops into battle and help guard the wizard enclaves. Although they are referred to as knights, they have no code of conduct, and the only rule that binds them is that their lives are worth nothing compared to the safety of the Red Wizards.

  <entry id="46307" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
The arcane duelist is a tricky, evasive opponent who relies on her foe's perceptions of her abilities as much as her actual abilities. Through magic, the arcane duelist can appear to be as dangerous as a duelist, but in general she does not do as much damage to her opponents. She prefers to win by cowing her opponent into defeating himself. Thus, Dexterity and Charisma are the arcane duelist's most valuable ability scores.

- Hit Die: d8
- Proficiencies: Arcane Duelists gain no proficiencies.
- Skill Points at Each Level: 4+ Int modifier.

REQUIREMENTS
Base Attack Bonus: +6
Skills: Perform 5 ranks, Tumble 5 ranks.
Feats: Weapon Proficiency Martial, Dodge, Mobility
Spellcasting: Level 1 Arcane spells.

ABILITIES:

Level
1: Chosen Weapon: Since much of the arcane duelist's apparent ability is tied to magic, the arcane duelist can imbue a specific melee weapon with powers to make herself appear more skilled. The arcane duelist must choose a specific melee weapon to be her chosen weapon.

2: Enchant Chosen Weapon: The arcane duelist's chosen melee weapon acts as if it has an enhancement bonus, even if it does not. If it does have an enhancement bonus, the arcane duelist adds this bonus to the weapon as an effective bonus. This can bring a weapon's effective enhancement bonus above +5. However, no weapon can have more than a +10 total effective bonus, so this class-granted effective bonus cannot be added to a weapon if the addition would increase the weapon's total effective bonus above +10. This class-granted bonus works only for the arcane duelist when wielding her chosen melee weapon. The enhancement bonus is +1 at 1st level, and rises to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, and +4 at 8th level.

2: Apparent Defense: Due to trickery and force of personality, the arcane duelist adds her Charisma bonus to her Armor Class, in addition to her Dexterity bonus.

3: Dexterous Attack: Because the arcane duelist values successful hits over actual damage dealt, she can subtract damage from her chosen melee weapon's potential damage and add the same amount to her attack bonus. However, the weapon must do a minimum 1 point of damage.

5: Blur: The arcane duelist can activate a blur effect, as the spell cast by a caster of her arcane duelist level. She can use this power once per day per arcane duelist level.

7: False Keenness: To create the idea that she is more effective than she really is, the arcane duelist can make her chosen melee weapon keen once per day per arcane duelist level. To activate the keen effect, she must subtract the weapon's normal threat range for critical hits from her attack bonus. For example, if the arcane duelist wields a rapier, she must subtract 3 from her attack bonus, since the rapier has a threat range of 18-20, to make it keen. The keen effect lasts for 1 round per arcane duelist level, and it does not stack with the keen edge spell or other magical effects that make a weapon keen.

9: Mirror Image: The arcane duelist can activate mirror image effect as the spell cast by a caster of her arcane duelist level. The images last one minute per level.

10: Flurry of Swords 1/day: The pinnacle of the arcane duelist's power is to create a flurry of sword attacks against a single target. When this power is activated, the arcane duelist makes one additional attack each round at her highest base attack bonus, but each attack that round suffers a -2 penalty. All attacks must be made on the same opponent. Further, the arcane duelist creates 1d4 quasi-real images plus 1 additional image per three levels of arcane duelist. Each image attacks the same opponent as the arcane duelist herself using the same bonuses as the arcane duelist. The images last for 1 minute per Arcane Duelist Level or the demise of their target, whichever lasts longest. You may target any given enemy only once per day with this ability.</entry>

The striking fist or flashing sword pales beside a psion's focused stare. Psionic powers arise from a regimen of strict mental discipline developed over months and years of self-scrutiny and subconcious discovery. Those who overcome their personal demons, fears, and other pitfalls of intense self-reflection learn to call upon an internal reservoir of psionic power. Psions depend on a continual study of their own minds to discover an ever wider range of mental powers. They meditate on memories and the nature of memory itself, debate with their own fragment personalities, and delve into the dark recesses of their minds' convoluted corridors. "Know thyself" is not just a saying for a psion - it's the road to power.

One who turns the mind's potential to the warrior's art is known as a psychic warrior. Where psions devote themselves wholly to the development of mind-engendered abilities, psychic warriors give emphasis to the development of the body. With mental and phsyical energy working on union, the psychic warrior strives towards martial perfection.

A soulknife recognizes his own mind as the most beautiful - and the most deadly - thing in all creation. With this understanding and through extended practice, a soulknife learns to forge his mental strength into a shimmering blade of semisolid psychic energy.
 Each soulknife's personal blade, referred to as a mind blade, differs in color and shape according to his personality, mental strength, and even mood. Although no two mind blades look alike, all share the same lethal qualities. Because soulknives turn the power of their minds to such weaponry, they are notorious for their violence.

Mind blade (Su): A soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways to a short sword. A mind blade is considered a magic weapon (+1) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
 A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enchancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.
 Implementation Note: For the purposes of interaction with Iaijutsu Master class, a mindblade in bastard sword form is considered equivalent to a katana. This is due to the fact that in PnP, katana = masterwork bastard sword.

Throw mind blade (Ex): A soulknife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mindblade as a ranged weapon. Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities.

Psychic Strike (Su): As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or a ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mond-affecting effects.)
 A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.
 At every four levels beyond 3rd, the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases by 1d8.

Free Draw (Su): At 5th level, a soulknife becomes able to materialize his mind blade as a free action instead of a move action. He can make only one attempt to materialize the mind blade per round, however.

Shape Mind Blade (Su): At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mindblade. As a full-round action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8) or, if he has Exotic Weapon proficiency, a bastard sword (damage 1d10).
 Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade. For example, a 12th-level soulknife normally creates a single +3 mind blade, but he could use this ability to instead materialize two +2 mind blades.

Mind Blade Enhancement (Su): At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add a weapon special ability that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.
 At every four levels beyond 6th, the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves by +1, A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level. For example, an 18th-level soulknife could add two +2 weapon special abilities, or one +1 weapon ability and one +3 weapon ability.
 The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decided to reassign it's abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.
 A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.

Bladewind (Su): At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.
 As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.
 When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell).
 The mind blade immediately reverts to it's previous form after the bladewind attack.

Knife to the Soul (Su): Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses, A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so a 19th-level soulknife could choose to strike for 3 points of Charisma damage and an extra 2d8 points of damage.

Multiple Throw (Ex): At 17th level and higher, a soulknife can throw a number of mind blades per round equal to the number of melee attacks he could make. Thus, a 17th-level soulknife could throw two mind blades, with a base attack bonus of +12/+7.


Epic Soulknife:

The epic soulknife is adept at channeling the entirety of his psychic might into the creation of an increasingly potent blade of mental energy.
  Hit Die: d10
  Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier.
  Mind Blade: At 25th level and every five levels thereafter, the soulknife gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (+6 at 25th, +7 at 30th, and so on).
  Mind Blade Enhancement: The epic soulknife's mind blade gains additional powers as the soulknife gains epic levels. At 22nd level and every four levels thereafter, the soulknife can improve the value of the weapon special abilities on his mind blade by 1 (+5 equivalent bonus at 22nd, +6 at 26th, and so on). As noted in the soulknife class description, reassigning qualities still takes 8 hours of concentration.
  Psychic strike: The epic soulknife's psychic strike progression continues past 20th level, continuing to grant an additional die (d8) of damage every four levels higher than 19th (+6d8 at 23rd, +7d8 at 27th, and so on).
  Bonus Feats: The epic soulknife gains a bonus feat every three levels higher than 20th (23rd, 26th, and so on).

The psion draws his psionic ability from strict mental discipline and intellectual development. Not so the wilder - for her, raw emotion is the source of psionic power.
Emotion-triggered psionic ability is not a science, but a passion. The zeal with which the wilder pursues the use of her psionic ability is so extreme that she can occasionally trigger a surge of power far beyond her normal capabilities. But with this ability comes a price: By exceeding her limits, the wilder may injure herself with psychic feedback.

Wild Surge (Su): A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).
A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.
Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.
This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).
She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.
At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at 15th level, by up to five; and at 19th level, by up to six.
In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the wilders power point reserve.

Psychic Enervation (Ex): Pushing oneself by invoking a wild surge is dangerous. Immediately following each wild surge, a wilder may be overcome by the strain of her effort. The chance of suffering psychic enervation is equal to 5% per manifester level added with the wild surge.
A wilder who is overcome by psychic enervation is dazed until the end of her next turn and loses a number of power points equal to her wilder level.

Elude Touch (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a wilders intuition supersedes her intellect, alerting her to danger from touch attacks (including rays). She gains a bonus to Armor Class against all touch attacks equal to her Charisma bonus; however, her touch AC can never exceed her Armor Class against normal attacks.

Surging Euphoria (Ex): Starting at 4th level, when a wilder uses her wild surge ability, she gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the intensity of her wild surge.
If a wilder is overcome by psychic enervation following her wild surge, she does not gain the morale bonus for this use of her wild surge ability.
At 12th level, the morale bonus on a wilders attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases to +2. At 20th level, the bonus increases to +3.

Volatile Mind (Ex): A wilders temperamental mind is hard to encompass with the discipline of telepathy. When any telepathy power is manifested on a wilder of 5th level or higher, the manifester of the power must pay 1 power point more than he otherwise would have spent.
The extra cost is not a natural part of that powers cost. It does not augment the power; it is simply a wasted power point. The wilders volatile mind can force the manifester of the telepathy power to exceed the normal power point limit of 1 point per manifester level. If the extra cost raises the telepathy powers cost to more points than the manifester has remaining in his reserve, the power simply fails, and the manifester exhausts the rest of his power points.
At 9th level, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on a wilder is increased to 2 power points. At 13th level, the penalty increases to 3 power points, and at 17th level it increases to 4 power points.
NWN implementation detail: This ability only affects powers manifested by a hostile manifester.


EPIC
The epic wilder's powers become even more volatile and unpredictable.

Hit Die: d6
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier
Powers: The epic wilder's manifester level is equal to her class level. The wilder's power points and powers known do not increase after 20th level (except through the use of epic feats).
Wild Surge: The epic wilder's wild surge continues to increase after 20th level. At 23rd level and every four levels higher than 23rd, the wild surge continues to gain an additional +1 boost to manifester level when used (+7 at 23rd, +8 at 27th, and so on).
Surging Euphoria: The wilders surging euphoria progression continues past 20th level. At 28th level and every eight levels higher than 28th, the morale bonus on her attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws increases by 1 (+4 at 28th, +5 at 36th, and so on).
Volatile Mind: The epic wilders volatile mind ability continues to increase. At 21st level and every four levels higher than 21st, the penalty assessed against telepathy powers manifested on the wilder is increased by 1 power point (5 points at 21st, 6 points at 25th, and so on).
Bonus Feats: The epic wilder gains a bonus feat at 21st level and every three levels thereafter (24th, 27th, and so on).

  <entry id="46367" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Psionics
Prerequisite: Ability to manifest powers.
Specifics: This set of feats implements the augmentation feature of psionic powers. They act as toggles, so the selected augmentation level persist until you change the setting or exit the module.
 When you manifest an augmentable power, the power is augmented according to your augmentation level active at the time. If this would increase the power's cost beyong what you can pay, the manifestation fails.
Use: Selected.

Technical: The augmentation feats are instant feats (NWN v1.66+) and take no action to activate.
Your augmentation level is the sum of your selections from the Augment 0 - 40 and Augment 0-4 or Augment 5-9 radials.
Normally, a quickselect sets your augmentation to whatever value you have placed in it (zero if unitialized).
To change the value stored in a quickselect, first use the Change Quickselect feat under Augment Psionics - Quickselects radial. Then, use any of of the quickselect feats within the next 10 seconds. The old value for that feat will be overwritten with your current augment value.</entry>

  <entry id="46395" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Wilder 1st
Specifics: A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).
A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.
Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.
This improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).
She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.
At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at 15th level, by up to five; and at 19th level, by up to six.
In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the wilder's power point reserve.

Level: Telepath 3

Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level)
Target: One breathing humanoid
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Will negates, Fortitude partial; see text
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 5
Metapsionics: Extend, Twin, Widen

You compel the subject to purge its entire store of air in one explosive exhalation, and thereby disrupt the subjects autonomic breathing cycle. The subjects lungs do not automatically function again while the powers duration lasts.

If the target succeeds on a Will save when crisis of breath is manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails its Will save, it can still continue to breathe by remaining in place and gasping for breath.

An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its Will save, the subject risks blacking out from lack of oxygen. It must succeed on a Fortitude save at the end of any of its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round after the first one that goes by without a breath; the DC drops back to its original value if the subject spends an action to take a breath.

If a subject fails a Fortitude save, it falls to 1 HP. In the following round, it drops to -1 hit points and is dying.

Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.
1. If you spend 2 additional power points, this power can also affect an animal, fey, giant, magical beast, or monstrous humanoid.
2. If you spend 4 additional power points, this power can also affect an aberration, dragon, elemental, or outsider in addition to the creature types mentioned above.
3. If you spend 6 additional power points, this power can affect up to four creatures all within a 20-ft.-radius burst.
In addition, for every 2 additional power points you spend to achieve any of these effects, this powers save DC increases by 1.</entry>

You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. **

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

On Target:
  You appear where you want to be.
Off Target:
  You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Far Off Target:
  You wind up somewhere completely different.
Mishap:
  You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

  <entry id="46802" lang="en" sex="m">Psychoportation (Teleportation)
Level: Nomad 9
Manifesting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 0 ft.
Effect: 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it
Duration: 10 min./level (D)
Saving Throw: None
Power Resistance: Yes
Power Points: 17

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you cant change it. The power fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.

Note: Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.


Implementation: At this time, the circle does not act as a trap, merely as a normal area of effect. This means that though it can be dispelled, it cannot be disarmed. Due to this, the option to have the circle be hidden is also disabled.</entry>

For the Frenzied Berserker, the insanity of battle is much like an addictive drug - she must constantly seek out more conflict to feed her craving for battle.

The Tempest is the point of calm within a whirling barrier of deadly blades. Poets use colorful terms such as dancer to describe the movement of a Tempest and her two blades, but mastery of this fighting style is not about dancing. Nor is it about impressing anyone - least of all poets. The Tempest focuses on learning the ultimate secrets of two-weapon fighting for a single purpose - the destruction of her enemies.

The Foe Hunter has but one purpose in life: to kill creatures of the type she hates. She is willing to pay any price or risk any danger to prevail against this hated foe. Her blade is anathema to such creatures, and her body is more often than not proof against their attacks. Though her hatred of this enemy is boundless and unending, it is not unthinking or rash. She lives to put an end to her hated foe, but she does not throw away her own life needlessly.

Most people think they've seen the worst that orcs can breed when an orc barbarian comes raging over a hilltop - at least until they see a one-eyed orc barbarian come raging over a hilltop. This creature may well be an eye of Gruumsh, an orc so devoted to his evil deity that he has disfigured himself in Gruumsh's name.

In an epic battle at the dawn of time, the elven deity Corellon Larethian stabbed out Gruumsh's left eye. Filled with rage and hatred, the orc deity called for followers loyal enough to serve in his image. Those who heed this call are known as the eyes of Gruumsh. They sacrifice their right eyes instead of their left ones so that their impaired vision balances that of their deity. Thus, symbolically at least, they can see what he cannot. These living martyrs to Gruumsh are some of the toughest orcs and half-orcs in the world.

- Hit Die: d12.
- Proficiencies: Eye of Gruumsh's gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.
- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Race: any Orcish race.
Alignment: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Neutral, or Neutral Evil.
Base Attack Bonus: +6.
Feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Weapon Focus (Orc Double-Axe).
Special: Follower of Gruumsh that has put his own right eye out during a ritual.

 1: Blind-Fight, Command the Horde, Rage
 2: Swing Blindly

 7: Blinding Spittle 4X day
 8: Blindsight, 10-foot radius

10: Sight of Gruumsh

NOTE: Your character will gain a blindsight feat on levelup as it should. However this feat currently has no function. I am waiting for patch 1.63 to see if Bioware opens up any functions that allow me to code a true blindsight ability.

The eye of Gruumsh can launch blinding spittle at any opponent within 20 feet. Using a ranged touch attack (at a -4 penalty), he spits his stomach acid into the target's eyes. An opponent who fails a Reflex save (DC 10 + Eye of Gruumsh level + Eye of Gruumsh's Constitution bonus) is blinded until he or she can rinse away the spittle. This attack has no effect on creatures that don't have eyes or don't depend on vision. Blinding spittle is usable twice per day at 4th level and four times a day at 7th level.

A Shifter has no form they call their own. Instead, they cloth themselves in whatever shape is most expedient at the time. While others base their identities largely on their external forms, the Shifter actually comes closer to their true self through all of their transformations. Of necessity, their sense of self is based not on their outward form, but on their soul, which is truly the only constant about them. It is the inner strength of that soul that enables them to take on any shape and remain themselves within.

(This PrC was created to bring the shifter closer to PnP rules.)

Epic Shifter

The epic Shifter has gone beyond the normal druidic ability to wildshape; no longer does she simply assume a new form when she changes shape. The epic Shifter actually becomes the new creature. Epic Shifters are rarely encountered in their true form; indeed, some of the most ancient and powerful Shifters claim (with some pride) to have forgotten their true form entirely.

Epic Shifters are generally a wild and carefree lot, and they prefer to spend their time exploring the multiverse and reveling in new forms and shapes they discover along the way.

Level:
11: Epic Wild Shape - Can turn into almost anything once a day, gaining some abilities of some of the shapes.
14: 3 Epic Wild Shape/day.
17: 5 Epic Wild Shape/day.
20: 7 Epic Wild Shape/day.
23: 9 Epic Wild Shape/day.
26: 11 Epic Wild Shape/day.
29: 13 Epic Wild Shape/day.

  <entry id="47233" lang="en" sex="m">A soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in all ways to a short sword. A mind blade is considered a magic weapon (+1) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
 A soulknife's mind blade improves as the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enchancement bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.
 Implementation Note: For the purposes of interaction with Iaijutsu Master class, a mindblade in bastard sword form is considered equivalent to a katana. This is due to the fact that in PnP, katana = masterwork bastard sword.</entry>

Prerequisites: Soulknife 2nd
Specifics: A soulknife of 2nd level or higher can throw his mindblade as a ranged weapon. Whether or not the attack hits, a thrown mind blade then dissipates. A soulknife of 3rd level or higher can make a psychic strike with a thrown mind blade and can use the blade in conjunction with other special abilities.
Use: Selected

  <entry id="47240" lang="en" sex="m">Psychic Strike</entry>
  <entry id="47241" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisites: Soulknife 3rd
Specifics: As a move action, a soulknife of 3rd level or higher can imbue his mind blade with destructive psychic energy. This effect deals an extra 1d8 points of damage to the next living, nonmindless target he successfully hits with a melee attack (or a ranged attack, if he is using the throw mind blade ability). Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects are immune to psychic strike damage. (Unlike the rogue's sneak attack the psychic strike is not precision damage and can affect creatures otherwise immune to extra damage from critical hits or more than 30 feet away, provided they are living, nonmindless creatures not immune to mond-affecting effects.)
 A mind blade deals this extra damage only once when this ability is called upon, but a soulknife can imbue his mind blade with psychic energy again by taking another move action. Once a soulknife has prepared his blade for a psychic strike, it holds the extra energy until it is used. Even if the soulknife drops the mind blade (or it otherwise dissipates, such as when it is thrown and misses), it is still imbued with psychic energy when the soulknife next materializes it.
 At every four levels beyond 3rd, the extra damage from a soulknife's psychic strike increases by 1d8.

Prerequisites: Soulknife 5th
Specifics: At 5th level, a soulknife gains the ability to change the form of his mindblade. As a full-round action, he can change his mind blade to replicate a longsword (damage 1d8) or, if he has Exotic Weapon proficiency, a bastard sword (damage 1d10).
 Alternatively, a soulknife can split his mind blade into two identical short swords, suitable for fighting with a weapon in each hand. (The normal penalties for fighting with two weapons apply.) However, both mind blades have an enhancement bonus 1 lower than the soulknife would otherwise create with a single mind blade. For example, a 12th-level soulknife normally creates a single +3 mind blade, but he could use this ability to instead materialize two +2 mind blades.

  <entry id="47246" lang="en" sex="m">Mindblade Enhancement</entry>
  <entry id="47247" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisites: Soulknife 6th
Specifics: At 6th level, a soulknife gains the ability to enhance his mind blade. He can add a weapon special ability that has an enhancement bonus value of +1.
 At every four levels beyond 6th, the value of the enhancement a soulknife can add to his weapon improves by +1, A soulknife can choose any combination of weapon special abilities that does not exceed the total allowed by the soulknife's level. For example, an 18th-level soulknife could add two +2 weapon special abilities, or one +1 weapon ability and one +3 weapon ability.
 The weapon ability or abilities remain the same every time the soulknife materializes his mind blade (unless he decided to reassign it's abilities; see below). The ability or abilities apply to any form the mind blade takes, including the use of the shape mind blade or bladewind class abilities.
 A soulknife can reassign the ability or abilities he has added to his mind blade. To do so, he must first spend 8 hours in concentration. After that period, the mind blade materializes with the new ability or abilities selected by the soulknife.
Use: Automatic on manifesting mindblades, select to change special abilities

  <entry id="47249" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisites: Soulknife 9th
Specifics: At 9th level, a soulknife gains the ability to momentarily fragment his mind blade into numerous identical blades, each of which strikes at a nearby opponent.
 As a full attack, when wielding his mind blade, a soulknife can give up his regular attacks and instead fragment his mind blade to make one melee attack at his full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. Each fragment functions identically to the soulknife's regular mind blade.
 When using bladewind, a soulknife forfeits any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the Cleave feat or the haste spell).
 The mind blade immediately reverts to it's previous form after the bladewind attack.
 This feat counts as Whirlwind Attack for the purpose of prerequisites.

Specifics: Beginning at 13th level, when a soulknife executes a psychic strike, he can choose to substitute Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma damage (his choice) for extra dice of damage. For each die of extra damage he gives up, he deals 1 point of damage to the ability score he chooses, A soulknife can combine extra dice of damage and ability damage in any combination, so a 19th-level soulknife could choose to strike for 3 points of Charisma damage and an extra 2d8 points of damage.

Werewolves are humanoids who can transform themselves into wolves. In its natural form, a werewolf looks like any other member of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of a wolf, but on close inspection, its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence.

The werewolf prestige class consists of two different classes the werewolf class and the wolf class. The first level you take in the werewolf prestige classes will always be a werewolf level. After that, every time you take a level in the werewolf prestige class, you must choose whether to level in the wolf or werewolf class.

In general leveling in the wolf class will improve your stats in your wolf and werewolf form. Leveling in the werewolf class, will give you additional abilities to use.

- Proficiencies: A Werewolf does not gain any additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Feats: True Lycanthrope or Iron Will

This power creates one 1st-level astral construct of solidified ectoplasm that attacks your enemies. It appears where you designate.

Astral constructs are not summoned; they are created on the plane you inhabit (using ectoplasm drawn from the Astral Plane). Thus, they are not subject to effects that hedge out or otherwise affect outsiders; they are constructs, not outsiders.

Prerequisite: Character level 6th
Specifics: Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below for what sort of cohort  the character can recruit.

A characters base Leadership score equals his level plus any Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat.

The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of a characters Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a cohort of a particular race, class, and alignment. The cohorts alignment may not be opposed to the leaders alignment on either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different from his own.

Cohorts earn XP as follows:
The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the partys XP.
Divide the cohorts level by the level of the PC with whom he or she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted the cohort).
Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohorts total.
If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than the associated PCs character level, the cohort does not gain the new levelits new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next level.

  <entry id="47883" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
Martial arts students face a bewildering array of martial arts schools, each with its own adherents and detractors. But few schools are as unusual -- or as controversial -- as Drunken Boxing. By weaving and staggering about as if inebriated, drunken boxers avoid many blows. Likewise, their stumbling, lurching attacks catch their opponents off guard. Moreover, when they actually imbibe alcohol, Drunken Masters can perform truly prodigious feats of strength and bravery.

- Hit Die: d8
- Proficiencies: The Drunken Master gains no proficiencies in weapons or armor.
- Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Base Attack Bonus: +4.
Class: Evasion class ability
Feats: Great Fortitude, Dodge.
Tumble: 6 ranks.

1: Drink Like a Demon - Your body handles alcohol differently from other people. Every bottle or tankard of alcohol you consume reduces your Dexterity, Wisdom, and Intelligence by 1 point each, but increases your Strength and Constitution by 1 point. However, your Reflex save bonus, Dexterity bonus to Tumble, and AC bonus remain at their original levels regardless of your new Dexterity modifier.
  Bottle Proficiency - You can use bottles as weapons using your unarmed base attack bonus.
2: Stagger - By tripping, stumbling, and staggering, you can make a charge attack that surprises your opponents.
3: Swaying Waist - You weave and bob about as you attack. You gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against any one opponent during your turn.
4: Disarm - Character can attempt to disarm an opponent at a -6 penalty to their attack.
5: Drunken Rage - Drunken Master can rage just as a barbarian does, with duration of 1 hour. You gain +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, and a 2 penalty to AC. This ability works when you drink an alcoholic beverage.
6: Lurch - Your lurching movements let you make one feinting-in-combat Bluff check (opposed by opponents Intelligence modifier + Charisma modifier) per round. On a successful feint, the opponents Dexterity modifier is not added to his AC on the Drunken Masters next attack. You can only lurch other humanoids.
7: Drunken Embrace - The Drunken Master can grapple an opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity, and you gain a +4 competence bonus on all opposed grapple checks.
8: For Medicinal Purposes - By combining your ki power with alcohol, you can convert an alcoholic drink to a potion of heal up to three times per day. Potion only works on character creating it.
9: Improved Disarm - Character no longer incurs an attack of opportunity while attempting to disarm and the penalty drops to -4.
10: Breath of Flame - You can use your ki to ignite the alcohol within you and spew it forth from your mouth in a breath of flame.</entry>

Second, your damage is increased for a short period of time due to the power of the charge.

Specifics: You can use furniture, farm implements, or nearly anything else at hand to attack your foes. Anything from a ladder to a haunch of meat to a barstool is a weapon once you imbue it with your ki using this ability. Regardless of the exact item, the weapon does 1d6 points of damage at your more advantageous number of attacks per round. Most items do bludgeoning damage, although shish-kabob skewers, for example, would do piercing damage. Items with broad, flat surfaces (such as tables) can be upended to become improvised tower shields. All unarmed bonuses still apply to Drunken Masters using Improvised Weapons.

Some spellcasters who discover the existence of the Shadow Weave are cautious, altering their magic slowly. Others are more reckless, and hurl themselves into the abyss of the Shadow Weave, immediately acquiring all the gifts available to the casual student and discovering secrets unavailable to all but the most dedicated. These spellcasters are the shadow adepts, who make great sacrifices in some aspects of the Art in order to reap greater benefits elsewhere.

  <entry id="48222" lang="en" sex="m">(BASE CLASS)
Rangers are skilled stalkers and hunters who make their home in the woods. Their martial skill is nearly the equal of the fighter, but they lack the latter's dedication to the craft of fighting. Instead, the ranger focuses his skills and training on a specific enemy - a type of creature he bears a vengeful grudge against and hunts above all others. Rangers often accept the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. His skills allow him to move quietly and stick to the shadows, especially in natural settings, and he also has special knowledge of certain types of creatures.

Effect: Ray
Duration: 1 min./level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes (object)

A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a dimensional anchor include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a gate or teleportation circle for the duration of the spell.

A dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, dimensional anchor does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.</entry>

Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: No

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. *

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. **

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

On Target:
  You appear where you want to be.
Off Target:
  You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Far Off Target:
  You wind up somewhere completely different.
Mishap:
  You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten scrambled. You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time Mishap comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

Spell Resistance: Yes

You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth of force planes. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesnt escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, forcing the subject to leave. *

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.
Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

Effect: 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it
Duration: 10 min./level
Saving Throw: None
Spell Resistance: Yes

You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you cant change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane.

The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.

Note: Magic traps such as teleportation circle are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find the circle and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 34 in the case of teleportation circle.


Implementation: At this time, the circle does not act as a trap, merely as a normal area of effect. This means that though it can be dispelled, it cannot be disarmed. Due to this, the option to have the circle be hidden is also disabled.</entry>

A Warchief leads a primitive, aggressive tribe of humanoids, especially when they turned to marauding. The Warchief calls on his indomitable presence and terrible visage to spur his followers to feats of great courage and sacrifice for the tribe. The tribe member who hangs back learns firsthand that the Warchief's displeasure is a terror eclipsing even the hardships of war - better to die in glory on the battlefield than under the Warchief's torturous punishments. Inspired into a killing frenzy, the Warchief and his band sweep the enemies of the tribe before their onslaught.

Specifics: With this feat you can make powerful but ungainly attacks. You may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number may not exceed your base attack bonus.
Use: Selected

Technical: The PRC Power Attack feats are instant feats (NWN v1.66+) and take no action to activate.
Your power attack selection is the sum of your selections from the 'Power Attack: 0 -4'  and 'Power Attack: 0 - 20' radials.
Normally, a quickselect sets your power attack to whatever value you have placed in it (zero if unitialized).
To change the value stored in a quickselect, first use the Change Quickselect feat under Power Attack - Quickselects radial. Then, use any of of the quickselect feats within the next 10 seconds. The old value for that feat will be overwritten with your current power attack value.

NOTE: Depending on PRC configuration variables, this may either behave either:
1) as described above
2) be limited to sacrifice only as much as you could using the Bioware Power Attack and Improved Power Attack feats
3) be completely disabled.</entry>

Calling upon the venomous powers of natural predators, you infect the subject with a horrible poison by making a successful melee touch attack. The poison deals 1d10 points of temporary Constitution damage immediately and another 1d10 points of temporary Constitution damage 1 minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Wis modifier).</entry>

This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the cloud).

A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding ones breath doesnt help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.Po</entry>

The subject contracts a particularly terrible and contagious disease, which strikes immediately with no incubation period. The caster infects the subject with a sickness that deals 1d4 points of Constitution drain each day until the subject dies. The subject may attempt a new saving throw each day, but she must succeed at two saves in a row to rid herself of the disease (as with most diseases).
However, the disease, once unleashed, continues to spread. For the first day of the sickness, anyone touching the subject must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or fall victim to the same malady. That victim in turn becomes contagious on the first day of her own affliction.

Specifics: To use this featm you must expend your psionic focus. You can chain any power that affects a single target and deals either acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic damage. After the primary target is struck, the power can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your manifester level (maximum twenty).

Prerequisites: None
Specifics: To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. You can twin a power. Manifesting a power altered by this feat causes the power to take effect twice on the area or target, as if you were simultaneously manifesting the same power two times on the same location or target. Any variables in the power (such as duration, number of targets, and so on) are the same for both the resulting powers. The target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a twinned Psionic Charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect).

  <entry id="49496" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
Combat magic is usually reserved for spellcasters in the second rank who are content to lob spells as if artillery from behind the cover of front-rank combatants. Not so the havoc mage, who shares as much in common with a fighter as with a wizard. The havoc mage has learned to toss off spells with such reckless abandon that he can fight head-to-head with both sword and spell without incurring the bitter consequences other spellcasters must contend with. A havoc mage is interested in maximum carnage in the shortest amount of time, by dint of a quick spell cast where an enemy least expects it. A havoc mage must first learn the ways of arcane magic, so those most likely to take up the sword (to complement the wand) are sorcerers and wizards. These normally sedate characters are drawn to the frenzy of battle, during which a flashing sword can be just as effect in their own hands as a well timed spell.

- Hit Die: d8.
- Proficiencies: A havoc mage does not gain any additional weapon or armor proficiencies.
- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Arcane Spellcasting: Able to cast 2nd-level spells.
Base Attack Bonus: +4
Skills: Lore 5 ranks.

ABILITIES:

Level
1: Battlecast 2nd level - A havoc mage gains the ability to cast 2nd level or lower spells while making a single weapon attack. Casting a spell in this manner does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
3: Battlecast 4th level
5: Battlecast 8th level

BONUS SPELLS

Every other level in Havoc Mage, the character gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in his highest arcane caster class. He does not learn any new spells through his abilities.</entry>
  <entry id="49497" lang="en" sex="m">Battlecast</entry>
  <entry id="49498" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class Specific.
Prerequisite: Havoc Mage level 1.
Specifics: A havoc mage gains the ability to cast spells of a certain level or lower while making a single weapon attack. Using battlecast does not provoke an attack of opportunity. To use this ability, merely turn it on. On all subsequent spells, you will perform a single attack against the spell target. However, if the spell target is out of range of your physical attack, it will not work, for example if you cast a spell at range while holding a sword you will not attack the target. At 1st level, this ability allows you to battlecast 2nd level or lower spells. At 3rd level this increases to 4th or lower, and at 5th level you may battlecast 8th or lower.
Use: Selected.</entry>

Living in the Underdark, they built a matriarchal society based on power and deceit. The drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be often mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink and blue. They also tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.

Drow females tend to be bigger and stronger than males. Drow society is theocratic and strongly matriarchal with females holding all positions of power and responsibility in the government, the militia and in the home. Their preferred class is cleric.
Drow males tend to be smaller and weaker than females. In society they tend to fill the lower ranks as fighters, rangers and rogues although their aptitude for magic is equal, if not superior, to that of other elven subraces. Their preferred class is wizard.

  <entry id="51042" lang="en" sex="m">(BASE CLASS)
Sometimes it is not enough to be a conquering warrior, a champion of all that's right, an experienced sellsword, or an elite foot soldier. Sometimes the circumstances require a solid commander of soldiers and situations. Sometimes the circumstances demand a marshal.

Marshals inspire trust in those they lead. They earn that trust by slogging through harsh landscapes, dangerous battlefields, and haunted catacombs along with those under their command. With a look, they can see where to best deploy their resources or come up with a sneaky ruse to fool their enemies. A marshal has a tactician's mind, a cartographer's overview of the disputed landscape (or dungeon warren), and a way with words that can inspire battle-hardened fighters to give it their all when melee breaks out.

- Hit Dice: d8.
- Proficiencies: Marshals are proficient with simple and martial weapons, all types of armor, and shields.
- Skill Points: 4 + Int Modifier (x 4 at 1st level).

ABILITIES:

A marshal gains Auras they may activate to boost themselves and all allies in a wide radius.  You can activate your auras as many times per day as you wish, and they will last until you choose to deactivate them (there is no time limit or limit on uses per day).  You may have 1 minor and 1 major aura active at any given time, but you must deactivate an aura before activating another of the same type (you may have to deactivate it twice).  Auras apply much further than the visual effect appears.

~Minor Aura~
Minor Auras give a boost to yourself and your allies based on your Charisma score.  Charisma is a Marshal characters primary stat.
Minor Auras are granted on levels

~Major Aura~
Major Auras give a goost to yourself and your allies based on your level.  The higher level you are, the greater the benefit of a major aura.
Major Auras are granted on levels

~Grant Move Action~
A marshal can haste himself and his allies for 1 round.  This ability may be used once per day per 4 class levels.</entry>

You shoot a ray of necromantic energy from your outstretched hand, causing any living creature struck by the ray to violently purge blood vessels through its skin. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect the subject. If successful, the subject is reduced to half of its current hit points (rounded down) and stunned for 1 round. On a successful Fortitude saving throw the subject is not stunned.

Also, the purged blood vessels are magically animated, creating a many layered mass of magically strong, adhesive tissue that traps those caught in it... Creatures caught within a 20 foot radius become entangled unless the succeed on a Reflex save. The original target of the spell is automatically entangled.

The entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, -4 to effective Dex, and can't move. An entangled character that attempts to cast a spell must succeed in a concentration check. Because the avascular mass is magically animate, and gradually tightens on those it holds, the Concentration check DC is 30...Once loose, a creature may progress through the writhing blood vessels very slowly.

You can sense the presence of creatures who bear a necrotic cyst (see spell of the same name). The amount of information revealed depends on how long you remain within range of a creature that triggers your cyst awareness:

1st Round: Presence or absence of creatures with necrotic cysts.
2nd Round: Number of creatures bearing necrotic cysts in the area.

Caster Level: Clr 2, sor/wiz 2
Components: V, S, F
Range: Touch
Target: Living creature touched
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

The subject develops an internal spherical sac that contains fluid or semisolid necrotic flesh. The internal cyst is noticeable as a slight bulge on the subject's arm, abdomen, face (wherever you chose to touch the target) or it is buried deeply enough in the flesh of your target that it is not immediately obvious-the subject may not realize what was implanted within her.

From now on, undead foes and necromantic magic are particularly debilitating to the subject-the cyst enables a sympathetic response between free-roaming external undead and itself. Whenever the victim is subject to a spell or effect from the school of necromancy, she makes saving throws to resist at a -2 penalty. Whenever the subject is dealt damage by the natural weapon of an undead (claw, bite, or other attack form), she takes an additional 1d6 points of damage.

Protection from evil prevents the necrotic cyst from forming. Once a necrotic cyst is implanted, spells that manipulate the cyst and its bearer are no longer thwarted by protection from evil.

You cause the cyst of a subject already harboring a necrotic cyst (see spell of the same name) to pulse and swell. This agitation of the necrotic cyst tears living tissue and expands the size of the cyst, dealing massive internal damage to the subject. The subject takes 1d6 points of damage per level (maximum 10d6), and half the damage is considered vile damage because the cyst expands to envelop the newly necrotized tissue. The cyst is reduced to its original size when the vile damage is healed. Vile damage can only be healed by magic cast within the area of a consecrate or hallow spell (or an area naturally consecrated or hallowed). Points of vile damage represent such an evil violation to a character's body or soul that only in a holy place, with holy magic, can the damage be repaired.

Your touch gradually transforms a living victim into a ravening, flesh-eating ghoul.  The victim takes 3d6 points of damage per round while the body slowly dies.  When the victim reaches 0 hit points, she becomes a ghoul, body and mind.

If the victim fails her saving throw, cure disease, dispel magic, Mordenkainen's disjunction, remove curse, or greater restoration negates the gradual change.  Healing spells may temporarily prolong the process by increasing hit points, but does not end the effects of the spell.

No matter how many ghouls you generate with this spell, however, you can control only 2HD worth of undead creatures per caster level.  If you are a cleric, any undead you might control via command or rebuke do not count toward the limit.</entry>

Prerequisite: Intelligence 13, Divine Spells level 2.
Specifics: You can cast any divine spell you have prepared as a rune. The caster must have the spell memorized to be able to create the rune. Crafting a rune costs Spell level * Caster level * 100 in gold pieces for a normal caster, and Spell level * Caster level * 50 for a Runecaster. It also takes XP equal to 1/25th of the cost. If you cannot pay the casting cost or the XP loss would drop you a level, the crafting will fail, and the spell will be lost. Crafting the rune requires a craft check vs DC 20 + Spell Level. If the craft check fails, the spell is lost, but the caster does not pay the gold and experience. A rune is permanent until used.

- Skill Points: 2 + Int Modifier.

REQUIREMENTS:

Divine Spellcasting: Able to cast 3rd-level spells.
Skills: Spellcraft 8 ranks, Craft Armour 8 ranks.
Feats: Inscribe Rune (This requires 13 Int and 2nd-level divine spells)

ABILITIES:

  <entry id="54757" lang="en" sex="m">Rune Craft</entry>
  <entry id="54758" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class Specific.
Prerequisite: Runecaster Level 1.
Specifics: The Runecaster gains a bonus on checks to create runes. This bonus starts at +1 at level 1, and increases to +2 at level 4 and +3 at level 7. In epic levels, the runecaster gets +4 at level 13, and an additional +1 every 3 levels (+5 at 16, and so on).

Prerequisite: Runecaster Level 2.
Specifics: All runes created by the Runecaster gain a bonus of +1 to DC and Spell Penetration checks. This bonus increases to +2 at level 5 and +3 at level 9. In epic levels, it increases at +1 every three levels, starting at level 12 (+4 at level 12, +5 at 15, and so on).

  <entry id="54761" lang="en" sex="m">Improved Runecasting</entry>
  <entry id="54762" lang="en" sex="m">Type of Feat: Class Specific.
Prerequisite: Runecaster Level 3.
Specifics: The Runecaster gains the ability to add more charges to an item at level 3. To do this, adjust the counter till you have selected the desired number of charges, then press the Rune Charges option to turn it on. Finally, cast the spell you wish to Inscribe. Inscribe Rune must be turned on for this to work. The cost for a charged item is Spell level * Caster Level * Charges * 50, while the XP cost is the gold cost/25.

At level 8, the Runecaster gains the ability to Inscribe runes that have Uses per day instead of charges. Follow the same procedure as for Charges, except select Rune Uses Per Day. The cost for a uses per day item is Spell level * Caster Level * Charges * 400, while the XP cost is the gold cost/25.

Turning on either Charges or Uses Per Day will turn off the other option, as they do not stack. The maximum number of charges is 50, while the maximum uses per day is 5. Rune Count +1 increases the number of charges or uses by 1, while Rune Count +10 increases the number by 10. Rune Clear resets the number to 1, the minimum.

You can sense the presence of evil. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject:
1st Round: Presence or absence of evil.
2nd Round: Number of evil auras (creatures, objects, or spells) in the area and the strength of the strongest evil aura present. If you are of good alignment, the strongest evil auras strength is "overwhelming" (see below), and the strength is at least twice your character level, you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. While you are stunned, you cant act, you lose any Dexterity bonus to AC, and attackers gain +2 bonuses to attack you.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

For any servant of a deity, no joy is greater than at those rare moments when the prescence of her patron deity is a real, tangible force, sending shivers of power through her body and sending her soul soaring. For some, the taste of this experience is such a powerful attraction that they begin devoting their lives to cultivating it, hoping to attain a greater closeness to their deity through a life of contemplation. Spending hours in prayer and meditation, these devoted followers purify their souls, making them worthy of closer contact with the divine. While some contemplatives withdraw from the world into private retreats, others remain active, even adventuring, finding that true nearness to their deity comes from living out their deity's will in the world.

 Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.

Mirror image creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a mirror image. When you and the mirror image separate, observers cant use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An images AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like theyre burned or dead after being hit by a fireball).</entry>

It is rumored that the magical powers of sorcerers and bards is somehow connected to the presence of dragon blood in their family tree. Dragon Disciples are sorcerers, and sometimes bards, who use their magical power as a catalyst to activate their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential. They prefer a life of exploration to a cloistered existence. Already adept at magic, many pursue adventure, especially if it furthers their goal of finding out more about their draconic heritage. They often feel drawn to areas known to harbor dragons.

  <entry id="55103" lang="en" sex="m">(BASE CLASS)
Ninjas move through the shadows, striking down the unwary and vanishing again with ease. Ninjas walk where others cannot. They blend their training in stealth and assassination with a focused mind. Their rigorous preparation sharpens their minds and bodies, giving them supernatural abilities of stealth and making them phantoms in the eyes of many. Although ninjas in battle lack the staying power of martial characters such as fighters or barbarians, they excel at making combat occur on their terms-appearing and disappearing seemingly at a whim.

The bane of all casters and their ilk is held within this single spell. It makes you virtually impenetrable by all spells, thus giving you immunity to magic, for a short period of time. It does not stop the flow of magic, but grants upon you ability to manipulate it to stop all harmful effects directed toward you. This does come at a cost however. You forfeit almost all of your endurance in the form of constitution in exchange for spell immunity while the spell is in effect. IE: Your constitution is dropped to 3.

The call of chaos affects the morals and sense of justice and order in all lawful creatures in the area, causing them to lose their vigilance for a brief time.

A word of caution to the caster of a lawful influence: You may begin to notice a lessening of your so-called diligent tendencies with each casting of this spell.

Tolodine's killing wind was designed to kill large numbers of creatures, and it worked well; wiping out whole tribes in a single cast. The original spell by Tolodine himself, covered many miles and lasted many hours. The rumor that Tolodine was headed toward your city put a sheer chill up your spine. It was said he walked solo to the battle field, and left solo. Fortunately, the epic vastness of its reaches was lost many ages ago, but the form we have now is still a vast power to be reckoned. Creatures caught within the cloud were entitled a saving throw vs. fortitude at a penalty of -4 or be killed by the spell. Those who remain within the cloud will need to make another save each successive round until they exit the cloud. The casting of this spell automatically temporarily drains the caster of two levels (bestowing negative levels upon him), and two constitution points until the spell evaporates.
