There are currently no Linux binaries of Moneo (or .SOs) with SQL support.

This is due in large part to the absence of SCO/RCO hooking in the Linux port of NWNX2, making the point of SQL in LetoScript nearly moot.

If you're running Linux, and you'd like to try and compile with SQL support, jump into LetoScript.inc and uncomment the {$DEFINE LETOSCRIPT_SQL} flag there. I suggest trying with the {$DEFINE LETOSCRIPT_SQL_LETO} flag for SQLite3 support, just as a test, and then (if you can get Zeos functioning in your Kylix), you could try with {$DEFINE LETOSCRIPT_SQL_ZEOS} for full MySQL support. If you get either working, I'd be interested in hearing about your experience:
