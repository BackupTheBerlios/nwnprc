[7:01:52pm] <@fluffyamoeba> Fox, you can go ahead and fix those if you want
[7:02:00pm] <@fluffyamoeba> as i've been menaing to do it since september
[7:02:05pm] <@Fox> oh the spells?
[7:02:09pm] <@fluffyamoeba> and i've not got anywhere
[7:02:39pm] <@fluffyamoeba> racial alter self for feyrii and rakshasa
[7:02:44pm] <@Fox> kay, I'll take a stab at it later
[7:02:44pm] <@fluffyamoeba> lich alter self
[7:02:59pm] joins: [1]ladydesire (~ladydesir@nwc-D1062AA6.suite224.net) (8 users)
[7:03:06pm] <@fluffyamoeba> and the spell disguise self (i don't think we have alter self)
[7:03:09pm] <@Fox> I'll probably do what I did with the changeling, and give both the 1000faces and shifter change shape feats
[7:03:18pm] <@Fox> for the racial ones
[7:03:34pm] <@fluffyamoeba> spells suffer from needing to memorise the spell again to cancel it
[7:03:54pm] quits: ladydesire (~ladydesir@nwc-BCC7C33A.suite224.net) (Ping timeout)
[7:03:56pm] [1]ladydesire (~ladydesir@nwc-D1062AA6.suite224.net) is now known as ladydesire
[7:04:04pm] <@fluffyamoeba> i was thinking maybe end scrying and end disguise could be made into subfeats
[7:04:05pm] <*Stratovarius> wb ld
[7:04:36pm] <*Stratovarius> yeah, we need the spell alter self as well
[7:04:38pm] <@fluffyamoeba> thing with feyrii is that they want one ofg the slots to be feyrii but no wings
[7:04:45pm] <*Stratovarius> hell, if you're feeling like distributing the poly thing widely
[7:04:49pm] <*Stratovarius> there's a ton i can point at
[7:04:55pm] <@fluffyamoeba> and lich one of the slots should be their pre-lich appearance
[7:05:14pm] <@fluffyamoeba> (as those two are used most often)
[7:05:21pm] <*Stratovarius> probaly a good idea to use the end scrying as a subradial feat
[7:05:26pm] <*Stratovarius> the cancellation series
[7:05:38pm] <@fluffyamoeba> at the moment, lich alter self at least lets you switch between lich and original
[7:05:45pm] <@fluffyamoeba> feyrii is just broken
[7:05:54pm] <*Stratovarius> lol
[7:05:57pm] <*Stratovarius> yeah :p
[7:06:00pm] <@fluffyamoeba> rak only lets you switch between original and rak iirc
[7:06:08pm] <@Fox> probably be easy to add a feat that jsut toggles the wings for teh fey'ri
[7:06:22pm] <@fluffyamoeba> feyrii get full alter self though
[7:06:28pm] <@fluffyamoeba> as do lich and rak
[7:06:31pm] <@fluffyamoeba> as SLAs
[7:06:47pm] <ladydesire> time to see how a Halfling Psion will fare in NWN1...
[7:06:59pm] <@Fox> I meant in addition to the regular change shape
[7:07:00pm] <@fluffyamoeba> :) so you could do it as seperate feats, or as one of the subfeats
[7:07:45pm] <@fluffyamoeba> hmm....i think that's most of the stuff in my notes
[7:08:33pm] <@fluffyamoeba> (i made some notes on how to do it in a very incomprehensible lecture)
[7:09:27pm] <*Stratovarius> fairly well, if you have a meatshield LD :p
[7:09:37pm] <@fluffyamoeba> i'd be really happy if you did them, as then i could do something else other than stare at my nearly blank script


replace "Return to True" on spells with 3rd quickslot
Set portrait to default "no port" portrait if dynamic and gender doesn't match - can be changed if 1.69 adds SetGender()
Rakshasa - Humanoid only
Lich - HUmanoid only, keep seperate feat for pre-lich form quickslot.
Fey'ri - have seperate feat for wings, is alter self humanoid or elf limited?
