Not doable/not worth it
Fell Flight - Not Doable
Weighty Utterance - not doable
Impenetrable Barrier - as Wall fo Force, but only 1 at a time, and take 1d10 if canceled by someone else. - Not Doable?
Crawling Eye - eye leaves head, can be used to scout(not doable, or do as Scry?)
Disembodied hand - detach hand, send it to manipulate objects or attack - use the "hand" from HotU as a summon? - Not doable, stupid familiar hardcoding

SUdden swarm - no spider swarm model
Thief's Bane(Cityscape) - Hold portal, explodes door(5d6) if knock or dispel cast or forced open - no hold portal, lock too unreliable
