*S* signifies a Sanctified spell. These need 
to have special colored icons; something that
portrays their exalted nature.  Maybe something
using gold, white, light blue or something. A 
possible example if you want to use it can
be found here:

If you like that coloration, that's fine.  If 
you would like to try to come up with something
better, go for it.  Up to you :P  Thanks for
helping us out with this, also. :D
