Spells and spell-like effects targeted on you are turned back upon the original caster. The abjuration turns only spells that have you as a target. Effect and area spells are not affected. Spell turning also fails to stop touch range spells. 
From seven to ten (1d4+6) spell levels are affected by the turning.
When you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. You and the caster each has a proportional chance to be affected.
If you and a spellcasting attacker are both warded by spell turning effects in operation, both you and the caster have a proportional chance to be affected.</entry>
