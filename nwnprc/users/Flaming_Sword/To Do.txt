[23:15] _-Maximus-_: hi all
[23:15] Flaming_Sword: hi
[23:16] Tenjac: lo
[23:17] somniloquy: Ooh, people talking. I don't suppose there's anyone here now who knows much about spellswords, orc warlords and/or dragonsong lyrists? I have problems with all three classes...
[23:17] Flaming_Sword: what kind of problems?
[23:18] somniloquy: With the spellsword, I can cast a spell into my sword using the channel spell ability, but then when I hit things the spell doesn't get released.
[23:18] somniloquy: With the orc warlord, I can't summon new orcs once my old ones die or are dismissed.
[23:18] somniloquy: With the dragonsong lyrist, my dragonsong of strength disappears when I get out of its initial radius, when it should persist until I cast a spell or use a magical device...
[23:19] Flaming_Sword: hmm...
[23:20] Flaming_Sword: lemme have a look
[23:20] Flaming_Sword: playing any module in particular?
[23:20] somniloquy: The spellsword and orc warlord are both in A Time for Heroes.
[23:20] somniloquy: The dragonsong lyrist is in the original campaign.
[23:21] somniloquy: Oh, and the dragonsong lyrist worked fine in chapter 1... it was the transition to chapter 2 that broke his ability, it seems.
[23:21] somniloquy: I've actually reloaded an earlier save game and taken a level of minstrel of the edge instead of dragonsong lyrist now, since it's a bit pointless being one if the main ability I took it for doesn't work :(
[23:22] somniloquy: I was planning on going for bard/dragonsong lyrist/minstrel of the edge, but have changed my plans to bard/minstrel of the edge/song dragon disciple...
[23:25] Flaming_Sword: what version of the prc?
[23:25] somniloquy: Um... the latest... 3.1 alpha 2, is it?
[23:25] Flaming_Sword: that's the one
[23:25] somniloquy: I upgraded to the alpha when the orc warlord failed to work for me in the latest stable release.
[23:30] _-Maximus-_: We've got a problem with database (2da cache) - it seems our module is trying to create new db.... is it possible? (we have MySQL over NWNXDB)
[23:31] * Flaming_Sword doesn't know jack about databases :(
[23:38] Stratovarius: It is if you donthave the DB in the right place
[23:38] Stratovarius: or are using a MySQL DB without caching it
[23:48] Flaming_Sword: at first glance, i have no idea what's causing those bugs, i'll copy down the chat logs to look at them later
