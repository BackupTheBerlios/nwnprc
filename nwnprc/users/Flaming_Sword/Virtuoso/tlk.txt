  <entry id="51223" lang="en" sex="m">(PRESTIGE CLASS)
The roar of the crowd, the praise of spectators after a great performance, the showers of gifts from attractive admirers - why would anyone trade all that for sleeping in the woods or poking around in smelly old dungeons? The virtuoso leaves creeping down dark corridors and matching wits against deadly traps to others. Her place is on the stage, surrounded by adoring fans. Fortunately for her, every place she goes becomes a stage, and as long as there's anyone around for her to impress, she's in the spotlight.

The typical virtuoso is outgoing, charismatic, and gregarious. She loves to be around people and is quick to win friends with her charming manner. Some might call her a temperamental egomaniac, yet everyone feels a little better in her presence.

Many virtuosos are musicians; others are accomplished dancers or actors. Still others choose to specialise in obscure and unusual forms of entertainment, such as stage magic or juggling.

Since entertainers are often on the road, a virtuoso can travel wherever she likes, incorporating as much adventuring into her journeys as she wishes. Because of her talent for winning admirers, she usually remains above suspicion should anything underhanded occur in a place she is visiting on tour.

Bards are most often drawn to this prestige class, although rogues, illusionists, and multiclass combinations of both can also excel in it. Bards tend to perform as musicians or actors, illusionists as stage magicians, and rogues as dancers, tumblers, or sleight-of-hand artists. Characters of most other classes are either not outgoing enough to enjoy being virtuosos, or they find other channels for their extrovertism.

SPELLS PER DAY/SPELLS KNOWN

Since the virtuoso often uses magic to enhance her performances, it's important for her to maintain her magical studies. Thus, whenever she gains a new virtuoso level, she gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats, new familiar abilities, and so on). This means that she adds her new level of virtuoso to the level of some other spellcasting class she has, then determines spells per day, caster level, and spells known (if formerly a bard or sorcerer) accordingly.

BARD SONG

At 1st level, the virtuoso gains the Bard Song ability if she did not already have it from a previous class. A virtuoso's class level stacks with Bard when determining the power of her Bard Song.

VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCE

With an impassioned soliloquy or a haunting melody, the virtuoso can create magical effects beyond even the capabilities of Bard Song. Virtuoso performance can be used once per virtuoso level per day. If the virtuoso has bard levels, those stack with virtuoso levels to determine uses per day. Many virtuoso performance effects require more than one of the ability's allotted daily uses. Virtuoso Performance effects last 10 rounds unless otherwise specified.
