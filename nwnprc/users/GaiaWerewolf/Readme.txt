I'm keeping files in here for the CEP/PRC merge hak.

Note on racialtypes.2da:
<GaiaWerewolf> CEP and PRC races work on a totally different system, correct?
<Stratovarius> yes and no
<Stratovarius> they both use racialtypes.2da
<Stratovarius> but CEP races are outdated andpartially non-funcational cause of the special abilities change
...
<GaiaWerewolf> Err... we use racialtypes entries from line 33?
<GaiaWerewolf> Wait, CEP subraces are broken anyhow
<Primogenitor> Yah, scrap the CEP ones.
<Stratovarius> exactly
<GaiaWerewolf> Ok, good
<Stratovarius> we blow away the lot

Unless the CEP updates racialtypes.2da (which is doubtful), I'll use the PRC ones and give a disclaimer for the rest.
