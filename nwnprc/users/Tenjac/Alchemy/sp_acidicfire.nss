Acidic Fire: The alchemical concoction combines alchemical fire with a strong acid. 
A direct hit with acidic fire deals 1d4 points of acid damage and 1d4 points of fire damage.
Every creature within 5 feet of the point where the acidic fire hits takes 1 point of acid 
damage and 1 point of fire damage from the splash. On the round following a direct hit, the 
target takes an additional 1d4 points of fire damage; this damage can be avoided in the same
way as for alchemist’s fire.
