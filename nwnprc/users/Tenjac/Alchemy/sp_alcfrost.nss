Alchemist’s Frost: A thin liquid that grows extremely cold when exposed to air, alchemist’s frost
functions like alchemists fire except that it deals 1d8 points of cold damage on a direct hit (and
1 point of cold damage on a splash), rather than fire damage. It deals no additional damage after 
the initial damage.
