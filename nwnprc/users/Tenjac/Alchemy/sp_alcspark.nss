Alchemist’s Spark: Alchemist’s spark combines two substances that react violently when mixed. 
A flask of alchemist’s spark has two compartments that keep the two substances separate; 
throwing the flask shatters it and allows the substances to mix, releasing a powerful electrical
discharge. Otherwise, alchemical sparl functions like alchemist’s fire except that it deals 1d8 
points of electricity damage on a direct hit (and 1 point of electricity damage to those it splashes),
rather than fire damage. It deals no additional damage after the initial damage.
