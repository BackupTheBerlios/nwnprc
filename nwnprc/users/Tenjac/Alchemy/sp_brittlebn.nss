Brittlebone: This unguent must be spread over a set of
bones before animation as a skeleton. The ointment reduces
the skeleton’s natural armor by 2 points (to a minimum of 0),
but when the skeleton is destroyed, its bones splinter and fl y
apart, sending shards in all directions. Any creature within
the skeleton’s reach takes 1 point of piercing damage per HD
of the skeleton (Refl ex DC 15 half; minimum 1 point).
