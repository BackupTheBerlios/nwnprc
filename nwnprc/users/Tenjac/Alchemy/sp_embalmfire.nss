Embalming Fire: This bitter-smelling liquid must
be poured over a corpse and allowed to soak for at least 1
minute before the corpse is animated as a zombie. Once
animated, if the zombie takes even a single point of
damage, it bursts into blue fl ame for 1 minute. This fi re
does no damage to the zombie, but its attacks during
that time deal an additional 1d6 points of fi re damage.
