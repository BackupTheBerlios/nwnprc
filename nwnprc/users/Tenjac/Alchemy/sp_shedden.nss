/*
Shedden: This gray paste is brewed from the exoskeletons
of monstrous spiders ground with silk-based oils and mixed
with various chemicals and reagents. When spread on your
exposed flesh, it temporarily hardens your skin, granting
you a +1 bonus to natural armor for 2 minutes. This bonus
stacks with any other natural armor you already have. It takes
1 minute to apply shedden to your entire body and obtain its
benefits.
Shedden can be created with a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check.
Certain master alchemists can create shedden that provides
natural armor bonuses of +2 to +5, but doing so raises the
Craft DC by 4 for each additional point of natural armor and
increases the price as follows: 200 gp for +2, 500 gp for +3,
1,000 gp for +4, and 2,000 gp for +5.*/
