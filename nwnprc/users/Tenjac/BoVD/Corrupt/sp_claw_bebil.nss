/**Claws of the Bebilith
Transmutation [Evil] 
Level: Corrupt 5 
Components: V, S, Corrupt 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Personal
Target: Caster
Duration: 10 minutes/level

The caster gains claws that deal damage based on 
her size (see below) and can catch and tear an 
opponent's armor and shield. If the opponent has 
both armor and a shield, roll 1d6: A result of 1-4
indicates the armor is affected, and a result of 5-6
affects the shield.

The caster makes a grapple check whenever she hits
with a claw attack, adding to the opponent's roll any
enhancement bonus from magic pos­sessed by the 
opponent's armor or shield. If the caster wins, the
armor or shield is torn away and ruined.
