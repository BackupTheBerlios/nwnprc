/**@file Morality Undone
Enchantment [Evil, Mind-Affecting] 
Level: Brd 5, Clr 5, Corruption 4, Mortal Hunter 4
Components: V, S, M/DF 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) 
Target: One non-evil creature 
Duration: 10 minutes/level 
Saving Throw: Will negates 
Spell Resistance: Yes 

The caster turns one creature evil. The 
chaotic/neutral/lawful component of the subject's
alignment is unchanged. The subject retains whatever
outlook, allegiances, and outlooks it had before, 
so long as they do not conflict with the new 
alignment. Otherwise, it acts with its new selfish,
bloodthirsty, cruel outlook on all things.

For example, a wizard might not immediately turn on 
her fighter companion for no apparent reason, 
particularly in the middle of a combat when they're
fighting on the same side. But she might try to steal
the fighter's bag of gems, even using applicable 
spells (charm person, suggestion, and invisibility, 
for instance) against her friend. She might even 
eventually decide to betray or attack her friend if 
there is some potential gain involved.

Using this spell in conjunction with a spell such as
dominate person or suggestion is particularly useful,
because it changes what acts are against a subject's 
nature.

Arcane Material Component: A powdered holy symbol.
