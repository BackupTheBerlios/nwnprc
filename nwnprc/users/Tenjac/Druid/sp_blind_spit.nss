Whipping your head forward with the last
word of the spell, you spit a globule of dark
liquid at your foe.
You spit caustic saliva into your target’s
eyes with a successful ranged touch
attack. A –4 penalty applies to the
attack roll. The subject is blinded until
it can wash its eyes with water or some
other rinsing fluid, which requires a
standard action.
This spell has no effect on creatures
without eyes or creatures that don’t
depend on eyes for vision.//
