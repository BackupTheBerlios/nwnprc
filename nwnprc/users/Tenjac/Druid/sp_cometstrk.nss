Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
Level: Druid 9
Components: V, DF

Duration: 3 rounds
Saving Throw: Refl ex partial
Spell Resistance: No
This spell may only be cast in an
outdoor area; it fails if cast indoors
or underground. When you cast this
spell, you cause three frozen comets to
strike down upon any three different
creatures or objects in range. You must
make a ranged touch attack to hit each
target. Each target struck takes 3d6
points of bludgeoning damage and
1d4 points of cold damage per level
(maximum 10d4), and is stunned for
one round. A successful Refl ex save
negates the bludgeoning damage
and the stunning effects, but not the
cold damage. Each round the spell
persists, another three frozen comets
rain down upon the original three
targets; as a standard action you can
select new targets for one, two, or all
three comets.
