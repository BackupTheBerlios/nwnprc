Reaching out your hand and making a
crushing motion, you turn the subject’s
sweat to ice, creating blisters as the ice forms
on and inside the skin.
The subject takes 1d6 cumulative points
of cold damage per round (that is, 1d6
on the 1st round, 2d6 on the second,
and 3d6 on the third). Only one save is
allowed against the spell; if successful,
it halves the damage each round.
Focus: A small glass or pottery vessel
worth at least 25 gp filled with ice,
snow, or water.//
