You cast small wooden statuettes on the
ground and they immediately grow into
adult worgs. The worgs growl at your foes,
their jaws slathered with spittle.
You turn small wooden carvings into
a number of worgs (MM 256) equal to
one for every two caster levels. These
worgs appear between you and your
opponents. They act on their own but
obey your mental commands. If the
worgs move beyond the range of the
spell, or at the end of the spell, the
worgs become carvings again. Killing
a worg destroys its focus item./
