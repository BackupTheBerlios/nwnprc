With a low thrumming sound, a blue beam
lances from your finger to strike your foe
and weaken him.
You must succeed on a ranged touch
attack with the ray to strike a target.
This ray causes creatures it hits to
become weak and slow for the spell’s
duration. A struck creature
takes a penalty to Strength
equal to 1d6+1 per two
caster levels (maximum
1d6+10). In addition, a
subject that fails a Will
save is slowed.
The spell’s slow effect
counters and is countered
by haste./
