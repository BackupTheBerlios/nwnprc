Area: One humanoid creature 
Duration: 1 round/level
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates 
Spell Resistance: Yes

The subject is wracked with such pain that he doubles
over and collapses. His face and hands blister and 
drip fluid, and his eyes cloud with blood, rendering
him blind. For the duration of the spell the subject
is considered helpless and cannot take actions. The
subject's sight returns when the spell's duration 
expires.

visibly shaken and takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls,
saves, and checks for 3d10 minutes.

Casting Time: 1 day
Range: Touch
Target: One living creature
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

Over the course of one day, the caster takes a subject
already in great pain­, wracked with disease, the victim
of torture, or dying of a wound, for example-and captures
its pain in liquid form. This physical manifesta­tion of
agony can be used to create magic items or enhance spells.
It can also be used as a potent drug.

Focus: A jar, vial, or other container for the liquid pain.

Saving Throw: Fortitude partial 
Spell Resistance: Yes 

A thousand needles surround the subject and pierce 
his flesh, worming through armor or any type of 
protection, although creatures with damage reduction
are immune to this spell. The subject takes 2d6 
points of damage immediately and takes a -4 
circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws,
skill checks, and ability checks for the rest of the
spell's duration. A successful Fortitude save reduces
damage to half and negates the circum­stance penalty.

Symbol (pain only)
Necromancy [Evil]
Level: Clr 5, Sor/Wiz 5
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 0 ft.; see text
Effect: One symbol
Duration: See text
Saving Throw: Fortitude negates
Spell Resistance: Yes

This spell functions like symbol of death, except that 
each creature within the radius of a symbol of pain 
instead suffers wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty
 on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.
 These effects last for 1 hour after the creature
 moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike symbol of death, symbol of pain has no hit point
 limit; once triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains 
active for 10 minutes per caster level.


Eternity of Torture
Necromancy [Evil]
Level: Pain 9
Components: V, S, DF 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) 
Target: One creature
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial 
Spell Resistance: Yes

The subject's body is twisted and warped, wracked 
forever with excru­ciating pain. The subject is 
rendered helpless, but-as long as the spell continues
-it is sustained and has no need for food, drink, or 
air. The subject does not age-all the better to ensure
a true eternity of unimaginable tor­ture. The subject 
takes 1 point of drain to each ability score each day
until all scores are reduced to 0 (except Consti­tution,
which stays at 1). The subject cannot heal or regenerate.
Lastly, the subject is completely unaware of its 
surroundings, insensate to anything but the excruciating
pain.

A single Fortitude saving throw is all that stands 
between a target and this horrible spell. However, 
even if the saving throw is successful, the target 
still feels terrible (but tempo­rary) pain. The target 
takes 5d6 points of damage immediately and takes a -4
circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, 
skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round per level 
of the caster.
