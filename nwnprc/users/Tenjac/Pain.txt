Eternity of Torture
Necromancy [Evil]
Level: Pain 9
Components: V, S, DF 
Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) 
Target: One creature
Duration: Permanent
Saving Throw: Fortitude partial 
Spell Resistance: Yes

The subject's body is twisted and warped, wracked 
forever with excruciating pain. The subject is 
rendered helpless, but as long as the spell continues
-it is sustained and has no need for food, drink, or 
air. The subject does not age-all the better to ensure
a true eternity of unimaginable tor­ture. The subject 
takes 1 point of drain to each ability score each day
until all scores are reduced to 0 (except Consti­tution,
which stays at 1). The subject cannot heal or regenerate.
Lastly, the subject is completely unaware of its 
surroundings, insensate to anything but the excruciating
pain.

A single Fortitude saving throw is all that stands 
between a target and this horrible spell. However, 
even if the saving throw is successful, the target 
still feels terrible (but tempo­rary) pain. The target 
takes 5d6 points of damage immediately and takes a -4
circumstance penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, 
skill checks, and ability checks for 1 round per level 
of the caster.
