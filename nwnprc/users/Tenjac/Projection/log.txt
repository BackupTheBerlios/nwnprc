[09:29] * Stratovarius smacks Tenjac, BN?
[09:30] <Tenjac> Trying to figure things out
[09:30] <Tenjac> tested last night be sure the VFX was still not removing
[09:31] <Stratovarius> Whats wrong so far?
[09:31] <Tenjac> I still need to handle the uses.  As far as I could tell, there is no GetRemainingUses() function
[09:31] <Tenjac> i might be missing it though
[09:32] <Stratovarius> i dont think there is, but thats just me
[09:32] <Stratovarius> you could just local int it
[09:32] <Tenjac> could, but how do I use that after I have the int?
[09:32] <Stratovarius> look at domains
[09:32] <Tenjac> ok
[09:32] <Stratovarius> the include
[09:32] * Tenjac makes note
[09:33] <Tenjac> Next, VFX not removing
[09:33] <Tenjac> I assume it's a delaycommand breaking the connection
[09:33] <Stratovarius> most likely
[09:33] <Stratovarius> it does that
[09:35] <Tenjac> We dicussed some way to fix that the other day, though I didn't logging going and forgot about it.  I remember you suggesting making it its own spell effect
[09:35] <Tenjac> *didn't have
[09:35] <Tenjac> and I remember ornedan saying it should already be functioning that wy
[09:35] <Tenjac> *way
[09:35] <TigerDragon> spell effect that is just a vfx
[09:35] <Tenjac> jep
[09:36] <Tenjac> Other than that, I think it's good to go
[09:36] <TigerDragon> i think primo's version was to hook it to a skill
[09:36] <Stratovarius> dont need to
[09:36] <TigerDragon> i was just repeating in case Tenjac was having issues with the spell effect version
[09:37] * Tenjac nods
