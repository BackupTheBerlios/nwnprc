ARROW STORM
Transmutation
Level: Ranger 3
Components: V
Casting Time: 1 swift action
Range: Personal
Target: You
Duration: 1 round

Your bow glows blue for an instant and
now feels as light as a feather in your hand.
In your mind’s eye you see the arrows in
your quiver, and your hand feels drawn
to them.
You can cast this spell only at the
beginning of your turn, before you take
any other actions. After casting arrow
storm, you can use a full-round action
to make one ranged attack with a bow
with which you are proficient against
every foe within a distance equal to
the weapon’s range increment. You can
attack a maximum number of individual
targets equal to your character level.
If you choose not to spend a full-round
action in this fashion after casting the
spell, the spell has no effect.
