[13:42] <Annihilator-X17> There's a function called EvaluateManifestation/Utterance
[13:43] <Annihilator-X17> and you put into it all the things it needs to know, then it calculates and spits out whether you can manifest, and a whole bunch of other things ;P
[13:43] <Annihilator-X17> basically, what this tells it is the power/utterance can have Empower and Extend
[13:43] <Annihilator-X17> and so it checks for both of em
[13:43] <Annihilator-X17> if they arent put in, it assumes the utterance cant have em and never even checks
[13:43] <Annihilator-X17> Quicken is done seperately and is always assumed to be on
[13:44] <Annihilator-X17> because you can quicken anything
[13:44] <Annihilator-X17> since there are only 3 metautters
[13:44] <Tenjac> right
[13:44] <Annihilator-X17> the only time you'll ever use it is if there is an extend/empower utter
[13:44] <Annihilator-X17> and that would look like (METAUTTERANCE_EXTEND | METAUTTERANCE_EMPOWER)
[13:45] <Annihilator-X17> as for type, that just tells it which of the three lexicons its looking at
[13:45] <Annihilator-X17> TYPE_EVOLVING_MIND, TYPE_CRAFTED_TOOL, TYPE_PERFECTED_MAP
[13:45] <Annihilator-X17> DC and targetting is different for the different powers
[13:45] <Annihilator-X17> utterances even
[13:47] <Tenjac> hehe
[13:48] <Annihilator-X17> easiest to use will end up being Perfected Map
[13:48] <Annihilator-X17> the DC is static at 25
[13:48] <Annihilator-X17> (there is erratta that makes the DC for it a formula, but who needs errata?)
