Chosen of Evil [Vile]
Your naked devotion to wickedness causes dark powers to
take an interest in your well-being.
Prerequisites: Con 13, any other vile feat.
Benefit: As an immediate action, you can take 1 point
of Constitution damage to gain an insight bonus equal
to the number of vile feats you have, including this one.
Until the end of your next turn, you can apply this bonus
on one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill
check. Make this decision before determining the result
of the roll.
