Dark Speech [Vile]
You learn a smattering of the language of truly dark power.
Prerequisites: Will save bonus +5, Int 15, Cha 15.
Benefit: You can use the Dark Speech to bring loathing and fear to others, to help cast evil spells and create evil magic
items, and to weaken physical objects.

Dread: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner,
you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and every other
creature in a 30-foot radius must attempt a Will save (DC 10
+ 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifi er). The result of
a failed save by a listener depends on the listener’s character
level and alignment, as detailed in the table below.

Power: Whenever you use Dark Speech in this manner,
you take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. By incorporating
the Dark Speech into the verbal component of a spell, you
increase its effective caster level by 1. 

Special: You gain a +4 circumstance bonus on saving
throws made when someone uses the Dark Speech against
you.

Special: If you cannot take ability damage, you cannot
select this feat.
