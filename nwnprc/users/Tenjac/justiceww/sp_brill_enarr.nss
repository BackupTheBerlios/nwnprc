This spell is cast upon a masterwork arrow or bolt, transforming
its head into brilliant energy that gives off light as a torch (20-
foot radius). A brilliant energy missile ignores nonliving matter.
Armor bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that
armor) do not count against it because the missile passes through
armor. It deals normal damage and has no effect on constructs,
undead, and objects. The arrow or bolt must be fired during the
same round the spell is cast, or the magic dissipates and is lost.
The projectile is destroyed even if it misses its target.
Material Component: Masterwork arrow or bolt.
