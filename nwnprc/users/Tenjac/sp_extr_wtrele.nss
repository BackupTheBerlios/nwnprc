/**@file Extract Water Elemental
Transmutation [Water]
Level: Druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 6
Components: V, S
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./level)
Target: One living creature
Duration: Instantaneous
Saving Throw: Fortitude half
Spell Resistance: Yes

This brutal spell causes the targeted
creature to dehydrate horribly as the
moisture in its body is forcibly extracted
through its eyes, nostrils, mouth, and
pores. This deals 1d6 points of damage
per caster level (maximum 20d6), or
half damage on a successful Fortitude
save. If the targeted creature is slain
by this spell, the extracted moisture is
transformed into a water elemental of
a size equal to the slain creature (up to
Huge). The water elemental is under
your control, as if you summoned it,
and disappears after 1 minute.
