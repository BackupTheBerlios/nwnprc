/**@file Sarcophagus of Stone
Conjuration (Creation) [Earth]
Level: Clr 6
Components: V S M DF
Casting Time: 1 standard action
Duration: Instantaneous
Range: Close (25 ft + 5 ft/2 lvls)
Target: 1 medium or smaler creature
Spell Resistance: No
Saving Throw: Reflex negates

This spell creates an airtight
stone coffin that forms around
the target. The stone is 1 inch thick, has
hardness 8, and requires 15 points of
damage to break through. Decreasing
its size does not change the thickness
of the walls; the coffin is always just
large enough to hold the subject. This
coffin is sealed upon formation and
completely impervious to air and gas. A
creature trapped within a sarcophagus of
stone has 1 hour worth of air, and after
that time must hold its breath or begin
to suffocate (DMG 304). A creature that
has no need to breathe (such as a construct,
elemental, or undead) needs not
fear suffocation, but it remains trapped
within the sarcophagus until it breaks
free or is freed.
A creature within the coffin can
attack the stone with a natural weapon
or light melee weapon. A creature can
attempt a DC 26 Strength check to
break free of the stone, and allies can
also help to break the trapped creature
free.

Material Component: A fragment of a
sarcophagus.
