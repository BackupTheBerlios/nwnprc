2008-08-04
==========
- prc's PDK constant changed to CLASS_TYPE_PRC_PDK
- references all changed to use it
- skills.2da fully updated to 1.69 (ride is at 27, iaijutsu focus at 33)
- inc_letocommands: SetDescription() changed to LetoSetDescription()
- iaijitsu focus, ride updated in cls_skill*** (phantom's stuff)
- balance and sense motive added to cls_skill*** from wojtekpod's list plus fox's post
- classes corrected to use the cls_skill_sol 2da for soldier of light
- added script diffs to user directory
- updated scripts: nw_c2_default7, nw_s0_healcirc, nw_s0_naturebal, nw_s0_negburst, 
  nw_s2_elemshape, nw_s2_wildshape, x0_s0_gustwind, x0_s0_udetfoe, x2_s2_cursesong, x2_s2_wildshape
- updated includes: x0_i0_spells, x2_i0_spells, x2_inc_spellhook

NOTE: X3ShapeShiftSpell() in x2_inc_spellhook needs other things adding to the 2da it references, plus 2da -> cache?
      nw_s2_elemshape, nw_s2_wildshape, x2_s2_wildshape won't compile with the horse stuff


2008-08-06
==========

- PRCHorseGetIsMounted() added to duplicate HorseGetIsMounted() without including x3_inc_horse 
  because of circular includes
- mount checks added to shifter includes and polymorph spells that use ShifterCheck() 

NOTE: hostile poly spells dont seem to use ShifterCheck(), might need to do something with those
