The PRC Companion CVS has recently been cleaned, it had a boatload of junk. I'm restoring it to a cleaner state which can then be easier maintained. Here are some of the things left to do:

- Create hi-res elemental textures for the creatures section (currently, there's only dinky ugly textures in the creatures/tga/ subdirectory) and create a DDS copy in the appropriate folder

- add 2da files along with bare lines, if possible

- add creature blueprints :P

- add the rest of the creature content. That's the most important right now.

- possibly add decompiled models to the cvs repository, they're compiled right now.

If a task is not in this list, tell me.
