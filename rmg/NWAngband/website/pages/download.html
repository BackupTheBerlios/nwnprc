		<h1>NWAngband - Download</h1>
		<p>
			Sorry to disapoint people looking to download this module right now, but Im afraid you can't. At least, not yet because it's not finished, or even in a Beta test form. When it is avaliable, I'll be sure to post lots of links to it everywhere so you can't miss it!
			<br />In the mean time, you might want to download some of the content I'll be using in advance.
		</p>
		<h3>Module</h3>
		<p>
			Not avaliable at this time, sorry!
		</p>
		<h3>Custom content</h3>
		This is a list of all the other content that NWAngband uses that you will need to download in order to play.
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://nwnprc.netgamers.co.uk/"target="_blank">PRC</a>
				Make sure to get both the main PRC, the java Character Creator, and the PRC Companion. I also suggest you spend some time reading the manual and playing with the PRC on other modules to become used to the new content and how it all works.</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.nwnctp.com/"target="_blank">CTP</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://store.bioware.com/products/wyverncrown.html"target="_blank">WCoC</a>
				NOTE: This is a bioware premium module though I use the tilesets associated with it. Bioware may include the tilesets in the NWN 1.69 patch, at which point Ill switch to using them instead. NWN 1.69 may or may not be out before the first version of NWAngband, so you might want to wait and see. However, I would thoroughtly recommend buying WCoC purely to play it, as its a great module and well worth the small pricetag.</li>
