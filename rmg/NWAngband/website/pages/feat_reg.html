		<h3>REG - Random Encounter Generator</h3>
		<p>
			In the PnP version of D&D there are extensive guidelines about balancing encounters to be a suitable challenge for PCs as well as what rewards should be given to match the challenges. The aim of the REG is to try to replicate this degree of balance within NWAngband. It is formed of two basic parts; firstly to select a suitable number and level of opponents, and then to spawn creatures appropriate to that. The selection of a suitable number/level of opponents is done using DRDTs based on the type of encounter you wish to create. The type of opponents are also done using a different set of DRDTs.
			<br />For simple creatures that scale based on racial hit dice, they are created at level 1 and scaled upwards to an appropriate level. For creatures that can take class levels, a large number of level 40 samples are stored in the database initially. Then when one of these creatures is required, a copy is taken from one of the samples and reduces to the appropriate level. Levelling down NPCs is faster than levelling them up, however the initial process of developing and storing them in the database is quite intensive; therefore, this is reserved for the more complex creatures. The REG interacts with the <a href="feat_rig.html">RIG</a> and REF systems to suitably equip creatures when created. It also acts with the PRS to setup reactions, and the RNG to suitably name creatures.
