		<h3><a id="faq" name="faq">Aims</a></h3>
		<p>NWAngband is a rogue-like module for Bioware's Neverwinter Nights similar in scope to Angband, Moria, NetHack, and to a lesser extent Diablo, Infinite Dungeons, and Endless Nights. Unlike traditional rogue-likes, NWAngband will have NWN's graphical engine as well as the D&D rule-system as the main backbone. Compared to Diablo, it will be strategic and have more options that just killing, plus in contrast to Infinite Dungeons, the enviroments will make more sense and have more "depth" to them.</p>
		<br />I aim to to make a module where:
		<ul>
			<li>I as designer cannot predict what is going to happen.</li>
			<li>both PCs and NPCs, follow the same rules.</li>
			<li>boring or repetive actions are streamlined away.</li>
			<li>players can choose the difficulty and style of challenge they want.</li>
			<li>actions and events have consequences, both for the players and the wider enviroment.</li>
			<li>the enviroment makes sense and follows its own self-consistent rules.</li>
			<li>gameplay is balanced overall, yet each character has their own time to shine.</li>
			<li>as a player improves, the game improves with them.</li>
			<li>people are not "rail-roaded" into specific courses of action.</li>
			<li>alignments, both morality and order, mean something, yet they are not a straightjacket for your actions.</li>
			<li>I enjoy playing it.</li>
		</ul>


		<h3><a id="faq" name="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h3>
		<p>If you have any questions you wish anwered, you can either <a href="mailto:primogenitor@nwangband.awardspace.com?subject=NWAngband">email</a> them to me or post them on the <a href="../phpBB2/index.php" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
		<a id="A brief history" name="A brief history"></a><h4>What do I mean by "roguelike"?</h4>
		<p>If you've never heard of the term before, the best source I can refer you to is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike"target="_blank">Wikipedia.</a> It is basically the term for a subgroup of role playing games (RPGs) involving a heavy degree of randomisation to avoid predictability and repetitiveness. The most famous example is probably <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/"target="_blank">Blizzard</a>'s <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo/"target="_blank">Diablo</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.blizzard.com/diablo2/"target="_blank">Diablo II</a>, though the roots of the genre start long before Diablo was a twinkle in Blizzards bank account.
		<br />The name NWAngband is derived from a branch of roguelike games based on JRR Tolkiens books starting with the earliest version named <a href="http://beej.us/moria/"target="_blank">Moria</a> then another generation named <a href="http://www.thangorodrim.net/"target="_blank">Angband</a>, the most popular derived version of which is <a href="http://www.thangorodrim.net/zangband.html"target="_blank">ZAngband</a>. As these were the roguelike games that most inspired me to this genre, it seemed fitting that I should make my Neverwinter Nights module NWAngband to continue the theme of putting abbreviations in front of the name. However, to be clear, nothing of the Angband code or any of the rules, game play mechanics, or plot are present in NWAngband.</p>

		<a id="What is NWN" name="What is NWN"></a><h4>What is Neverwinter Nights?</h4>
		<p><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/"target="_blank">Neverwinter Nights</a> (NWN) is a <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome"target="_blank">Dungeons and Dragons</a> (D&amp;D) rules-based computer RPG (cRPG) released originally in 2002 with expansion packs <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/shadows/"target="_blank">Shadows of Undrentide</a> (SoU) and <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/underdark/"target="_blank">Hordes of the Underdark</a> (HotU) released in mid  and late 2003 respectively. There have also been a number of additional <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/premium/"target="_blank">Premium Modules</a> released for the game.
		<br />In addition to all this official content, there has been a huge amount of free community-create content. The largest repository of such content is <a href="http://nwvault.ign.com/"target="_blank">NWVault</a> which I suggest you have a look around if you want to get an idea of how wide and varied the NWN community is.
		<br />For an overview of the rules and game play content in NWN, I suggest you have a look at the <a href="http://www.nwnwiki.com/"target="_blank">NWN Wiki</a> as well as the manual section of the <a href="http://nwnprc.netgamers.co.uk/"target="_blank">PRC</a> website.

		<a id="Is NWAngband new" name="Is NWAngband new"></a><h4>Is NWAngband anything new?</h4>
		<p>It is true that there have been similar modules for NWN before. Probably the most prominent of them was one of Biowares own Premium Modules, <a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/premium/module_infinitedungeons.html"target="_blank">Infinite Dungeons</a>; however in my opinion this was not very successful; it is very CPU intensive to play and has a large number of nonsensical combinations.
		<br />Then there are the other games, such as Diablo II. This is a very different type of RPG to Neverwinter nights, being far more action-based and with much less non-combat opportunities. I don't like that style of game, and I like the depth and familiarity of the D&D rule set.</p>

		<a id="NWN2" name="NWN2"></a><h4>Isn't NWN2 coming out soon?</h4>
		<p>Yes, NWN2 will be out shortly (at the time of writing). So why am I basing this project on the old NWN1? The reasons are quite complicated, but basically NWN1 is a stable base I know thoroughly with a well-established set of community content and resources. NWN2s community on the other hand, will move very quickly and include a lot of unknowns. That is something I don't want to have to deal with any more, having coped with it for the last few years of NWN1.</p>

		<a id="download" name="download"></a><h4>Where can I download NWAngband?</h4>
		<p>You cant. At least, not yet. When it is available, Ill be sure to post lots of links to it everywhere so you can't miss it!</p>
