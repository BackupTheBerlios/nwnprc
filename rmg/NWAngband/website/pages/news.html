			<p>Slow days I know, real life is taking its toll. I am making progress in terms of integrating the systems into a single module again. Taking quite a while to get things started as Im tending towards creating tools to do the work for me, rather than doing it by hand. Takes longer in the short-term, but should be useful in the long-term. Added a new screenshot to the media as an update, though it doesnt show much.

			<p>This week I have mostly been working on filling in the RAD information. I have made a brief tool to generate most of the basic placeable blueprints for me, but I have still got a lot of blanks to fill in on the details of what to do with stuff (e.g. does it go against the wall, can it be walked over, etc) as well as the spawn tables themselves. Still, once this part is completed, it should be done for the majority of the placeables, at least roughly. This means NWAngband can generate a wide range of stuff straght away, which is good because I have also picked out the initial 3 styles of areas Im going to build with; CTP Dwarven Halls, CTP LOK Dungeon, and CTP Dungeon reskin. All quite similar I know, but it should give me a good dungeon-diving baseline to work from.
			<br />Also posted some threads on the forum on some lesser systems. Im still looking for feedback/suggestions on these, so please read and reply! In particular, I am curious about peoples opinions about sound, music, and other ambient signals such as the use of light and darkness. I also have a more computer-based thread about visible distance and fog that I'd like some feedback on.
			<br />Plus, I have had a very good idea about the overall background / plot theme, which should suit me well and allow me to add some neat features in once the basic game is done. So all in all, though I havnt updated this for a while, I have been thinking about stuff!

		<li><h5>22/10/06</h5>
			<p>Updates are flowing thick and fast at the moment, dont panic though, Im sure it wont last! Managed to get the RIG to working particularly well today, and posted some screenshots to celebrate. It still needs the data tables filling a bit more, and in particular the randomized appearance parts. Added a couple of old "proof of principle" stage screenshots and a small movie showing the RAD system in action.

		<li><h5>21/10/06</h5>
			<p>Added a forum, powered by <a href="http://www.phpbb.com" target="_blank">phpBB2</a>. Go visit the new forum and post away! Also updated the glossary, added a footer to each page (with XHTML & CSS checker and email contact information), and expanded the features section a bit more.
			</p>

		<li><h5>17/10/06</h5>
			<p>I got hostage! At the moment it's on <a href="http://nwangband.awardspace.com">nwangband.awardspace.com</a> so we'll see how it goes and if I want to stay there or not.
			</p>
			<p>As far as content goes, I've got a news page (obviously) and a sidebar with links to other stuff. The <a href="intro.html" target="main">introduction</a> section has some background and the <a href="features.html" target="main">features</a> section has some information about some of the features of NWAngband. There is a placeholder page for media, but I havn't got anything to go in there yet, and the download page is mostly placeholder too as I havn't released anything yet.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><h5>16/10/06</h5>
			<p>On this day, this corner of the web was born! We shall see if this ever gets hosted somewhere or not, eventually. As I'm still learning (X) HTML, CSS, and all the other web technologies, this should hopefully be something of an educational exercise too, so hopefully it will get a lot better (i.e. snazzier) with time.
