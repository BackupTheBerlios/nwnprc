RWG pre-alpha test

Expect bugs, & expect it not to work. That way you wont be disapointed!

Note: This requires java v1.5 or higher. Make sure you have the latest version

Basically, it loops over the terrain.2da rows, and makes the files for each row.
Each row corresponts do a separate world map and a separate area.
The coumns are as follows:
Label      		Output filename & area name. Must be unique.
TileX 			Size of area. Possible bugs if not a power of 2 and not square.
TileY 			Size of area. Possible bugs if not a power of 2 and not square.
VertexsX 		Number of vertexs per tile. Possible bugs if not a power of 2 and not square.
VertexsY 		Number of vertexs per tile. Possible bugs if not a power of 2 and not square.
PixelPerVertex 		Number of pixels per vertex. Number of vertexs. Possible bugs if not a power of 2.
Roughness 		Related to size of "features". 0.0 - 1.0 only.
WaterLevel 		Water level. related to land/water ratio. 0.0 - 1.0 only.
TerrainList		2da filename describing texturing patterns

Terrainlist.2da columns are as follows:
Label      		human label only
Type 			0 = apply a texture from terrain_texture.2da, 1 = alter terrain by terrain_height.2da
Reference		line number of the 2da to read

Terrain_texture.2da columns are as follows:
Label      		human label only
minHeight 		Minimum height for this texture. 0.0-1.0 only
maxHeight 		Maximum height for this texture. 0.0-1.0 only
minSlope 		Minimum difference in nearby heights for this texture. 0.0-1.0 only, suggest around 0.1 max.
maxSlope 		Maximum difference in nearby heights for this texture. 0.0-1.0 only, suggest around 0.1 max.
colourminR 		Red component of darkest colour. 0-255
colourminG 		Green component of darkest colour. 0-255
colourminB 		Blue component of darkest colour. 0-255
colourmaxR 		Red component of lightest colour. 0-255
colourmaxG 		Green component of lightest colour. 0-255
colourmaxB 		Blue component of lightest colour. 0-255
parentID 		row of parental terrain. Will only appear on-top of parental terrain.
fractalScale 		Related to size of "features" for colours. 0.0 - 1.0 only.
amount  		Fraction of posible surface covered. 0.0 - 1.0 only.
distribScale 		Related to size of "features" for coverage. 0.0 - 1.0 only.
heightOffset		ignored

Terrain_height.2da columns are as follows:
Label     		human label only
Type 			0 = rim		param1 = proportion of terrain to rim
			1 = plateau	param1 = min height
					param2 = max height
					param3 = new height
			2 = smooth	param1 = min height
					param2 = max height
Param1 			varies, see type
Param2 			varies, see type 
Param3 			varies, see type
Param4 			varies, see type
